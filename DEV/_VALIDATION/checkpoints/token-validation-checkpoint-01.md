# 📍 Token Validation Checkpoint #1

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- Reviewed current Aragon documentation (app.aragon.org and docs.aragon.org)
- Extracted all token-related claims from our implementation guide
- Verified token parameters against Aragon platform capabilities
- Assessed feasibility for zero-balance deployment
- Created validation report with findings and recommendations

## 🛑 Critical Issues Identified
- **Zero-Balance Deployment Not Possible**: Ethereum transactions require gas, making zero-balance deployment technically impossible
- **Current Aragon Interface**: Token creation UI differs from our documentation, integrated into DAO creation
- **Vesting Implementation**: Aragon does not have built-in vesting, requires custom contracts

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Research alternative blockchain networks with lower gas costs
- Develop "bootstrap-first" implementation plan assuming minimal initial funding
- Create phased deployment approach focusing on critical functionality first
- Modify token deployment documentation to match current Aragon interface
- Research faucet options for testnet deployment validation

## 📊 Validation Metrics
- Claims Fully Verified: 25%
- Claims Requiring Modification: 50%
- Claims Contradicted: 25%

## 🔍 Research Questions for Next Phase
1. What is the minimum ETH required for basic Aragon DAO deployment?
2. Which Layer 2 or alternative networks does Aragon support?
3. What are the most gas-efficient token distribution methods?
4. Are there simplified vesting approaches that require less gas?
5. Can we implement governance-enforced vesting before technical vesting?

## 📝 Notes
- The core distribution (40/30/20/10) is sound and aligns with BAD DAO 2.0 requirements
- The 14-day implementation timeline is still achievable with a modified approach
- Bootstrap focus must shift to securing minimal initial funding for deployment
- Consider simplified governance approach before complex technical implementation
- Revenue-driven approach should prioritize minimal viable DAO first
