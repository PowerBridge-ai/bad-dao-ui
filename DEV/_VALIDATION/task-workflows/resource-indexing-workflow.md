# üìö Resource Indexing Workflow

## üéØ Purpose
This workflow provides a standardized process for building comprehensive, organized resource libraries for each PowerBridge.AI course. These libraries serve as reference materials for students, validation evidence for course claims, and supporting documentation for course content.

## üìù Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Collection

#### Step 1: Resource Category Definition
- Review course content and identify key topic areas
- Define resource categories aligned with course structure:
  - Official documentation
  - Tutorials and guides
  - Code repositories and examples
  - Tools and services
  - Community resources
  - Case studies
  - Academic resources
  - Monetization examples
  - Advanced topics
- Map resource needs to specific course sessions
- Identify critical vs. supplementary resource requirements

#### Step 2: Research Collection
- Conduct thorough search for each resource category:
  - Official product/tool documentation
  - GitHub repositories and code examples
  - YouTube tutorials and channels
  - Blogs and technical articles
  - Academic papers and research
  - Community forums and discussions
  - Case studies and success stories
  - Industry reports and analyses
  - Books and courses
- Document initial findings in raw resource list
- Include metadata (URL, date, author, format)

### Phase 2: Evaluation & Organization

#### Step 3: Resource Evaluation
- Assess each resource against quality criteria:
  - **Accuracy**: Correctness of information
  - **Currency**: How recent/up-to-date
  - **Comprehensiveness**: Depth of coverage
  - **Clarity**: Easy to understand
  - **Practicality**: Applicable to real-world use
  - **Authority**: Credibility of source
- Assign quality rating (1-5 scale)
- Flag core vs. supplementary resources
- Identify resources for validation evidence
- Document any discrepancies or contradictions

#### Step 4: Organization & Tagging
- Develop tagging system for resources:
  - Topic tags (aligned with course sections)
  - Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Resource type (Documentation, Tutorial, Code, etc.)
  - Core/Supplementary designation
  - Verification status (if used for validation)
- Tag each resource with appropriate metadata
- Group resources by course session/module
- Create resource relationship map for connected topics

#### Step 5: Annotation & Summaries
- Create concise summary for each core resource
- Add annotations explaining relevance to course
- Document key takeaways from each resource
- Note specific sections or elements of importance
- Include practical application context
- Highlight any caveats or limitations
- Add time estimates for consuming the resource

### Phase 3: Documentation & Integration

#### Step 6: Integration & Cross-Reference
- Link resources to specific course content:
  - Session materials
  - Exercise references
  - Project requirements
  - Validation claims
- Create cross-reference system between related resources
- Map revenue claim evidence to specific resources
- Identify implementation examples for practical exercises
- Document gaps where additional resources may be needed

#### Step 7: Resource Index Documentation
- Compile final resource-index.md document:
  - Table of contents by category
  - Session-specific resource lists
  - Comprehensive resource database with all metadata
  - Top resources by topic area
  - Getting started guide for resource utilization
- Create student-friendly resource guide
- Document resource validation connections
- Prepare internal reference notes for instructors

   - 3: Credible source with demonstrated knowledge
   - 2: Source with limited established credibility
   - 1: Unknown source or questionable credibility

### Overall Resource Rating

Calculate overall rating based on the average of all criteria, with additional designations:

- **Core Resource**: Essential reference for course (top 20%)
- **Recommended**: Strong secondary resource (next 30%)
- **Supplementary**: Additional resource for specific needs (remaining 50%)
- **Validation Evidence**: Used to verify course claims (special designation)
