#### Step 5: Resource Integration
- Compile comprehensive resources for each topic:
  - Documentation links
  - Tutorial references
  - Tool guides
  - Community forums
  - Alternative approaches
  - Advanced reading
- Create resource index with annotations
- Organize resources by topic and difficulty
- Include validated case studies and examples

### Phase 3: Review & Finalization

#### Step 6: Content Review
- Validate all content against research validation reports
- Check for technical accuracy and currency
- Verify code examples are functional
- Ensure content alignment with learning objectives
- Validate practical exercises are achievable
- Review for completeness and clarity
- Identify and fill any content gaps

#### Step 7: Final Documentation
- Finalize all course documents:
  - curriculum.md: Complete course overview
  - session-1.md through session-8.md: Detailed session content
  - resource-index.md: Comprehensive resource library
  - references.md: Citations and attributions
