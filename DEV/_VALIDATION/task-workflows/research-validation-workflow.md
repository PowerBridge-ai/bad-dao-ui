## 📝 Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### Step 1: Claim Identification
- Extract all factual claims from course material
- Categorize claims by type:
  - Skill viability claims
  - Tool functionality claims
  - Revenue projections
  - Market demand claims
  - Implementation feasibility claims
- Prioritize claims based on importance to course objectives

#### Step 2: Research Planning
- Define research questions for each claim
- Identify potential sources for verification:
  - Academic research
  - Industry reports
  - Expert testimonials
  - Case studies
  - Tool documentation
  - Market analyses
  - Competitor reviews
- Create research plan with timelines and priorities

### Phase 2: Research Execution

#### Step 3: Source Collection
- Gather relevant sources for each claim
- For each source, document:
  - Source URL/reference
  - Publication date
  - Author/organization
  - Credibility assessment
  - Relevance to claim
- Ensure diversity of sources for comprehensive validation

#### Step 4: Claim Verification
- Compare claim against collected sources
- Assess accuracy on 5-point scale:
  1. Fully verified with strong evidence
  2. Largely verified with some caveats
  3. Partially verified with significant caveats
  4. Largely unverified with minimal evidence
  5. Completely unverified or contradicted
- Document specific evidence supporting or contradicting claim
- Note any conditions or contexts that affect claim validity

#### Step 5: Evidence Documentation
- Create structured evidence database for each claim
- Link evidence directly to course content
- Format evidence for easy reference:
  - Claim: [Original claim from course]
  - Verification Status: [1-5 scale rating]
  - Primary Evidence: [Strongest supporting evidence]
  - Supporting Evidence: [Additional verification]
  - Caveats/Conditions: [Limitations or contexts]
  - Sources: [Full list of referenced sources]

### Phase 3: Analysis & Integration

#### Step 6: Gap Analysis
- Identify claims with insufficient validation
- Determine what additional research is needed
- Decide whether to:
  - Conduct additional research
  - Modify claims to match evidence
  - Remove unvalidated claims
  - Add appropriate disclaimers/caveats
- Create action plan for addressing gaps

#### Step 7: Validation Report
- Compile comprehensive validation report:
  - Executive summary of validation status
  - Detailed claim-by-claim verification
  - Evidence database
  - Gap analysis and recommendations
  - Suggested content modifications
- Include validation status metrics:
  - Percentage of claims fully verified
  - Distribution of verification ratings
  - Areas requiring modification

## 🔄 Validation Process Integration

### Integration with Content Creation
1. **Pre-Creation Validation**:
   - Validate core course concepts before detailed content
   - Establish evidence base for main revenue claims
   - Verify key tool functionality

2. **During-Creation Validation**:
   - Reference evidence database during content creation
   - Add appropriate caveats and conditions
   - Include range of expected outcomes

3. **Post-Creation Validation**:
   - Review complete content against validation reports
   - Ensure all claims are properly supported
   - Add disclaimers where appropriate

### Documentation Requirements
1. Update resource-index.md with all research sources
2. Create validation.md with claim-by-claim verification
3. Add validation status indicators to curriculum.md
4. Include appropriate disclaimers in course materials

## 📈 Success Criteria

A successfully validated course meets these criteria:

1. **Accuracy**: 90%+ of claims rate 1-2 on verification scale
2. **Transparency**: All revenue claims include full distribution
3. **Realism**: All implementation steps verified as executable
4. **Currency**: All tools and methods verified as current
