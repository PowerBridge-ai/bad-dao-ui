Governance Tokens: These are typically issued to stakeholders within the DAO. Token holders can vote on proposals, changes to the protocol, or funding allocations. The amount of tokens a person holds often determines the weight of their vote.

Proposals: Proposals are suggestions for changes or actions that members can vote on. They could be anything from protocol upgrades, funding decisions, or changes to governance itself.

Voting Mechanisms: The DAO typically uses a voting system to decide on proposals. This could include simple majority votes, quadratic voting (where the cost of voting increases as the number of tokens increases), or more complex mechanisms.

Delegation of Votes: In many DAOs, members can delegate their voting power to another member. This is helpful when a token holder doesn‚Äôt have the time or expertise to vote on every proposal but still wants to retain influence. This delegation is often done via smart contracts.

Governance Smart Contracts: These are the backbone of DAO governance. They automate processes like proposal submission, voting, and execution of decisions once proposals pass. These contracts are typically immutable once deployed, ensuring fairness and transparency.

Treasury Management: Many DAOs hold a treasury of funds, which is often managed and allocated by the community through voting. Members vote on how the funds should be spent or invested.

Incentives: DAOs often have incentive mechanisms to encourage participation in governance, such as rewards for contributing to proposals or voting on key decisions.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these components? Or are you focusing on something specific, like delegation or voting mechanisms?








You said:
Well, I'm building a UI for building DAOs, and I'm trying to kind of get an understanding of what the specific categorization underneath it should be. And so that means, like, I'm looking more towards, I see where you're going with it, like, in order to have governance, you have to have the tokenomics, right? And once you have the tokenomics, then you have, like, voting and proposals. You have to understand, like, what kind of rules go around proposals. And then you have, like, delegates, right? Who are the roles or who are the players who can vote, right? And how much tokens do they get in the best case? So I get, like, where governance comes in, but I need, like, a checklist. You know what I mean? Like, this isn't complete governance until you have these fundamental pieces. And then there's other pieces that are kind of optional. That's what I'm looking for.


ChatGPT said:
Got it! You're looking to define a clear structure for DAO governance in your UI, where you can differentiate between the essential components and the optional ones. Here's a checklist that breaks it down into fundamental and optional pieces:

Essential Components of DAO Governance (Fundamental Pieces)
Governance Tokenomics

Token Issuance: Define how tokens are distributed to participants (e.g., through staking, airdrops, or contributions).

Token Utility: Clarify how tokens are used in governance (e.g., voting, staking, rewards).

Voting Power: Determine how voting power is distributed (e.g., one token = one vote, or quadratic voting).

Voting System

Voting Mechanism: Choose the type of voting (e.g., simple majority, quorum, weighted voting, quadratic voting).

Voting Period: Define the duration of voting (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).

Voting Threshold: Set minimum requirements for a proposal to pass (e.g., majority, supermajority, quorum).

Proposals and Proposal Rules

Proposal Creation: Define who can create proposals (e.g., token holders, a specific governance body).

Proposal Categories: Classify types of proposals (e.g., protocol upgrades, funding decisions, new governance models).

Proposal Approval Criteria: Define the criteria for a proposal to pass (e.g., majority approval, minimum vote count).

Proposal Execution: How proposals are executed once approved (e.g., smart contracts automatically trigger actions).

Delegation of Voting Power

Delegation Process: Allow members to delegate their voting rights to trusted delegates.

Delegate Management: Enable delegates to vote on behalf of others, and specify if delegates can propose as well.

Revocation: Allow delegation to be revoked if needed.

Roles and Players

Governance Roles: Identify key roles within the DAO, such as:

Token Holders: Individuals with governance tokens who can vote.

Proposers: Individuals or entities that can submit proposals.

Delegates: Individuals trusted to vote on behalf of others.

Admins (Optional): Some DAOs may have admin roles with elevated privileges (e.g., for emergency actions).

Role Permissions: Define what each role can and cannot do within the governance system.

Treasury and Fund Management

Treasury Allocation: Determine how funds are managed and allocated (e.g., to specific proposals, grants).

Budget Approval: Define how the DAO approves spending from the treasury (e.g., through proposals or voting).

Optional Components of DAO Governance (Additional Features)
Reputation Systems

Reputation-based voting power (separate from tokens) based on actions, contributions, or activity in the DAO.

On-chain Identity and Profiles

Reputation or profiles tied to on-chain activity, rewarding contributions and providing transparency.

Automated Decision Making

Some DAOs may use automated decision-making processes (like AI or oracles) for specific actions or proposals.

Transparency and Reporting

Dashboards that show voting history, proposal stats, and treasury health.

On-chain records and transparent audits.

Voting Mechanisms with Penalties

Penalty mechanisms for inactive voters or delegators (e.g., slashing rewards if they don't vote).

Incentivizing participation (e.g., rewarding voters or delegates).

Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Governance

Some DAOs might require multiple people to sign off on a proposal before it is executed.

Emergency Shutdown Mechanisms

Define mechanisms to halt operations or pause governance in case of emergency.

DAO Governance Tokens Staking

Allow governance tokens to be staked for additional benefits or rewards, potentially influencing decision-making.

Governance Checklist Summary
Fundamental:

Governance Tokenomics (issuance, utility, voting power).

Voting System (mechanism, period, thresholds).

Proposals and Proposal Rules (creation, categories, approval, execution).

Delegation of Voting Power (process, revocation).

Roles (token holders, proposers, delegates, admins).

Treasury Management (allocation, budget approval).

Optional:

Reputation Systems.

On-chain Identity and Profiles.

Automated Decision Making.

Transparency and Reporting.

Voting with Penalties.

Multi-Signature Governance.

Emergency Shutdown.

Token Staking for Governance.

This breakdown should give you a solid foundation for building out the governance components of your DAO UI. You can then decide which of the optional components are useful to your DAO's specific use case. Would you like to focus more on any particular area, or maybe build out some mock UI components?

It sounds like you're creating a space for collaboration or discussion in your project, which is great! Are you planning to implement a chat room feature in your DAO governance UI for feedback and discussion around proposals or decisions? If you need any help with setting that up, feel free to share the details!

You said:
Okay so this is what I need specifically I need AA functioning list for my AI agent to be able to ask our users in order to be able to functionally build out their governance smart contract just by having a conversation with them so what's your project about i'm in tokens how many voters who are the roles and and basically walk through a conversation if they say I don't know at any one of the steps of these questions then you need to have a cycle or iterative loop that helps them get through it so that same thing that you do where you ask me very useful questions at the end of every prompt it needs to be there a prompt response I should say it needs to be something like that so if they ever say I don't know for any of these answers you need to have like a list of suggested answers for each step of the way go ahead and make that for me
ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ ChatGPT RESPONSE #1

Absolutely. Below is a Functioning Conversational Framework for your AI agent to walk users through building a governance smart contract for a DAO. This framework includes:

Step-by-step prompts (conversation steps),

Fallback loops when users respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù

Suggested answer choices or decision frameworks for indecisive users.

The goal is to gather all critical governance parameters while making the experience intuitive and user-friendly, even for non-experts.

üß† FUNCTIONAL CONVERSATION FLOW FOR DAO GOVERNANCE SETUP
ü™™ STEP 1: Project Context
Prompt:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with your project. What is your DAO about, and what is its primary purpose?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or aren‚Äôt sure:

‚ÄúHere are some common DAO types to choose from. Pick the one that best describes your project‚Äîor feel free to describe it in your own words.‚Äù

Protocol DAO (governs a blockchain/protocol)

Investment DAO (pools funds to invest)

Grant DAO (distributes funds for grants)

Service DAO (delivers services to clients)

Social DAO (built around communities/interests)

Collector DAO (NFT or asset acquisition)

ü™ô STEP 2: Token Design
Prompt:

‚ÄúWill your governance use a token? If yes, what will the token be called?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúMost DAOs use a token to represent voting power. Would you like help choosing between the following options?‚Äù

Use ERC-20 token for voting

Use reputation-based voting (no token, score-based)

Use NFT-based governance (each NFT = 1 vote)

Hybrid (tokens + activity-based reputation)

Follow-up if token-based:

‚ÄúHow many tokens will you mint in total? Do you want to limit the supply?‚Äù
If unsure:

1 million (fixed cap, common starter)

10 million (growth-focused)

Unlimited (mint-as-needed for utility-based DAOs)

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë STEP 3: Roles and Permissions
Prompt:

‚ÄúWho are the participants in your DAO and what roles will they have? (e.g., token holders, delegates, admins, council members, etc.)‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúHere are some roles you might want to include. Pick what makes sense for your DAO or modify as needed.‚Äù

Token Holders ‚Äì can vote

Proposers ‚Äì can create proposals

Delegates ‚Äì can vote on behalf of others

Admins ‚Äì optional trusted role with special permissions

Multisig Signers ‚Äì execute critical actions

üìä STEP 4: Voting Mechanics
Prompt:

‚ÄúHow should voting work in your DAO? (E.g., how long do votes last, what % of votes are needed to pass, etc.)‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúHere are common default settings. You can change them later:‚Äù

Voting Duration: 3 days

Quorum Required: 20% of total tokens must participate

Passing Threshold: 50% of votes must approve

One Token = One Vote: Yes / No

Allow Delegation?: Yes / No

üìù STEP 5: Proposal Rules
Prompt:

‚ÄúWho can create proposals and what‚Äôs required for a proposal to go live?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúHere are some suggested setups:‚Äù

Any token holder can propose

Only holders with X tokens can propose (e.g., 1000 tokens)

Proposal must be seconded (endorsed by others)

Proposal fee to prevent spam (e.g., 10 tokens)

üßæ STEP 6: Treasury & Fund Management
Prompt:

‚ÄúWill your DAO have a treasury? If yes, who can access or vote on fund allocations?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúMost DAOs use a treasury contract controlled by governance. Pick a starting setup:‚Äù

Funds released via proposals

Multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe)

Community-approved budget cycles

Admin-controlled (for early-stage DAOs only)

üõ°Ô∏è STEP 7: Emergency or Override Mechanisms
Prompt:

‚ÄúWould you like an emergency shutdown or override mechanism in case something goes wrong?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúHere are common options for fail-safes:‚Äù

Multisig-controlled pause function

Admin with limited override powers

No emergency controls (fully decentralized from day one)

üìö STEP 8: Governance Contract Options
Prompt:

‚ÄúDo you want to deploy using a pre-built governance framework like OpenZeppelin, DAOstack, or Tally-compatible Governor Bravo?‚Äù

If they answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù:

‚ÄúThese are common smart contract templates you could start from:‚Äù

OpenZeppelin Governor ‚Äì well-audited, modular

DAOstack (Alchemy) ‚Äì reputation-based DAOs

MolochDAO v2 ‚Äì simple & minimal, membership-based

Aragon DAO ‚Äì UI-driven setup

Tally-compatible Governor Bravo ‚Äì flexible, powerful

üîÅ INTELLIGENT LOOP HANDLER (for "I don‚Äôt know" at any step)
At every step, if the user answers:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù
‚Üí Agent replies with:
‚ÄúNo problem. Here are a few common approaches other DAOs use. You can pick one, or ask me to explain further.‚Äù

Always include:

üß† Educational tips (brief explanation)

‚úÖ Suggested default choices

üîÅ Option to revisit this step later

üß© BONUS: Dynamic Follow-Ups
After a user selects an option, prompt with a clarifying question like:

‚ÄúGreat choice. Would you like to allow changes to this setting later via community vote?‚Äù

‚úÖ Final Output
After completing all steps, your AI agent should:

Summarize all responses.

Offer a ‚ÄúGenerate Smart Contract‚Äù option.

Offer a ‚ÄúReview & Edit‚Äù step.

Optionally deploy to testnet or GitHub repo.

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next:
Would you like this turned into a modular script or chatbot flow for your UI?

Should we begin scaffolding a Streamlit / Flask / React interface to implement this conversational flow?

Do you want this tied to a specific contract template (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor, Aragon)?

Let‚Äôs pick one and start building!

All right there's I like this a lot the only thing I would like you to add is two types of dials a project Dow which is based upon a grant or funding or some kind of the distributed funding towards a startup or towards a directive project with a certain umm structured outcome right whether that's going to be a product a service MVP something along those lines what I would like you to do is add the project dao as well as the corporate DAO now the corporate down is something a little bit different it is a expanded infrastructure where we actually have full corporate structure in the voting system of the down and so the same decision making structures that you would have all the from the top down from ACEOCTO president Vice President Board members chairman all that **** I directors team leads regional managers office managers and whatever other higher up decision making positions that there are in that corporate structure try not to make it over a 25 rolls please specifically for this one but but we want to have a very specific controlled Outcome for the corporate dial and so that means I want to have the full layout governance treasury management all of the the fun stuff that we get with quarterly meetings and budget meetings and finance meetings and project updates and all of the good stuff


ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ ChatGPT RESPONSE #2

Perfect. You're introducing two critical DAO archetypes that are increasingly relevant but often underrepresented: the Project DAO and the Corporate DAO. I‚Äôve added both into the governance agent framework and built out each one with:

Definition and Purpose

Governance Structure

Roles (max 25 for Corporate DAO)

Special Considerations (e.g., reporting, voting structures, finance, KPIs)

This will expand your AI agent's ability to guide users into building complete and highly-functional DAO setups aligned with more real-world structures.

üß† UPDATED DAO CATEGORIES
üî∑ 1. Project DAO
Definition: A DAO designed to execute a specific initiative or fund a startup-like venture. May focus on building a product, delivering a service, creating an MVP, or achieving a defined mission.

Purpose Prompts for Users:

What specific outcome or deliverable will your DAO fund or produce?

Is the DAO intended to dissolve or convert once the project is complete?

Governance Design:

Proposal-based milestone funding

Voting on deliverables

Team-based task delegation

DAO lifespan: finite (until goal is hit) or extendable

üè¢ 2. Corporate DAO
Definition: A fully-structured DAO modeled after a traditional corporate hierarchy, intended to maintain complex operational, financial, and leadership structures with decentralized enforcement.

Purpose Prompts for Users:

Are you creating a decentralized alternative to a traditional company?

Will you need structured departments (e.g., HR, Ops, Legal, Product, Marketing)?

How do you plan to run executive oversight and accountability?

Governance Design:

Role-weighted voting or voting classes

üîÅ Agent Conversation Flow (Additions for These Types)
New Step 1 Prompt: DAO Type

‚ÄúWhat type of DAO are you building?‚Äù
If they select Project DAO or Corporate DAO, the AI agent will branch accordingly.

For Project DAO:

‚ÄúWhat is the deliverable or milestone you‚Äôre building toward?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho will be the core contributors?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to automatically wind down the DAO after project completion?‚Äù

For Corporate DAO:

‚ÄúDo you want a full corporate role structure?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow often should you hold board or shareholder meetings?‚Äù

üîÑ Modular Design Suggestion
We can break this into governance modules:

Module: DAO Type Selection

Module: Tokenomics & Voting Power

Module: Roles & Permissions

Module: Treasury Management

Module: Proposal Logic

Module: Meeting & Reporting

Module: Fallback Assist (I don‚Äôt know handler)

These can plug into your app‚Äôs backend or chatbot agent.

‚úÖ What's Next:
Would you like a diagram or flowchart of this branching conversational logic?

Do you want this translated into a JSON schema or YAML format for agent ingestion?

Shall we begin prototyping the Project DAO and Corporate DAO conversation flows in a conversational UI?

And lastly um once all of the structure is built through this conversation with the AI then there needs to be a secondary walkthrough for automation now in the process we can do automation for each step and ask them hey do you want to automate this step and then go through the process of asking how scheduling things adding conditions triggers events alerts notifications that kind of thing for each automation level or we can have a process in which we have a workflow where we just build out the thing and then layer in automation with one go but it's it's it's it's you know like completely automate the automation if that makes sense or have a custom automation where maybe you have like automation templates so for scheduled events like payouts for projects payouts for core teams payouts for specific roles what happens when funds hit the Treasury where do they go is there it is just a basic split is it a basic pipeline of funding or is it sophisticated and how sophisticated does that treasury pipeline and automation need to be access control on those funds who has the ability at what roles and and what levels are fund access allowed that kind of intricate conversation needs to be had as well but only only to the point where it's needed so all the whole super super advanced version of this isn't required but you still need to have the the formula kind of like a shoots and ladders type of thing or a guided RPG where you have a series of paths to get to predetermined outcomes and those predetermined outcomes just ending templates and structured formatted prompts that we can send through our AI to pass to nebula AI the third web AI or the 3rd web SDK to be able to just build out edit these smart contracts and then automate them and keep them running live on the blockchain

You've just unlocked Phase 3 of DAO UX architecture ‚Äî what I‚Äôll call Automated Governance Infrastructure (AGI). This is not just about governance logic; it‚Äôs about automating decentralized operations from Day 1 using:

Conversation-driven Smart Contract creation

Smart Workflow Templates

AI-Powered Automation Planning

Conditional Triggers, Events & Permissions

Live Scheduling & Ongoing DAO Ops

I‚Äôm breaking your requirement into 4 functional layers and then delivering the modular conversation+logic workflow system you asked for:

üîß LAYERED DAO CONSTRUCTION FRAMEWORK
‚úÖ Layer 1: Governance Builder
Conversational UI to build DAO logic (Roles, Voting, Treasury, Proposals, Structure, DAO Type)

Already created above (Project DAO + Corporate DAO models)

‚úÖ Layer 2: Smart Automation Planner (New)
After the governance is defined, this second conversation layer guides users to automate DAO functions, one by one or using preset templates.

Two Modes of Automation Planning:

üß© Option A: Inline Automation (Recommended for Simplicity)
As each governance component is defined, AI asks:

‚ÄúWould you like to automate this step?‚Äù

If yes ‚Üí Automation Assistant flow kicks in:

Schedule?

Trigger type? (event, vote, time, fund movement)

Alert or notification?

Conditions or access controls?

Do you want an AI to optimize this logic for you?

üß† Option B: Automation Layer Mode (Bulk Automation After DAO Setup)
After the governance is complete, user enters Automation Wizard.

The agent shows:

üìã ‚ÄúHere are your DAO components.‚Äù

üîß ‚ÄúWhich would you like to automate?‚Äù

üß∞ For each selected item, user chooses:

Template or Custom Automation

Trigger-Condition-Action definitions

Scheduling, Alerts, Permissions, and Webhooks

üîÑ LAYER 3: Conversation Tree w/ Prebuilt Automations
üß† Template Automations (AI Assistant Can Recommend These)
Category	Template Name	Trigger	Action	Notes
Treasury	Core Team Payout Scheduler	Recurring (Monthly)	Transfer % to team wallets	Role-based, multisig optional
Grant Milestone Release	Proposal vote approved	Unlock milestone tranche	Useful for Project DAOs
Treasury Diversification	Treasury balance change	Auto-swap or stake %	DeFi plugin optional
Governance	Board Meeting Scheduling	Time-based (Quarterly)	Trigger board vote sequence	Sends calendar invites
Proposal Alert Flow	Proposal created	Notify stakeholders by role	Customizable per role
Access Control	Role-Based Fund Access	Manual or vote-based	Set access rights in contract	Token threshold gating
HR & Ops	Performance-Based Rewards	KPI met or vote passed	Mint/send token bonus	Needs metrics input
Marketing	Campaign Budget Drip	Time-based	Scheduled token drip to campaign	Based on marketing wallet
Compliance	Multisig Enforcement Rule	Fund transfer > X	Require multisig confirmation	Optional override logic

üîÅ Conditional Conversation Logic (I Don‚Äôt Know ‚Üí Path A / B / C)
If user says: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to automate this‚Äù

Agent responds with:

‚ÄúNo problem ‚Äî would you like to‚Ä¶‚Äù

A) Choose from templates

B) Describe what you want in plain English

C) Let AI generate automation based on your DAO type?

Each selection triggers a preset path. For instance:

‚ÄúOkay! You‚Äôre a Corporate DAO. Based on similar setups, I‚Äôd suggest:

Quarterly Board Vote Triggers

Monthly Department Budget Releases

Role-gated Access Controls

Scheduled Team Updates to Dashboard
Want to activate any of these?‚Äù

üß¨ Layer 4: Code & Contract Execution Engine
Once automations are finalized, AI outputs are turned into structured smart contract prompts or templates formatted for your tool stack.

Integrations You Mentioned:

‚úÖ Nebula AI: Decision engine for logic-based contract generation

‚úÖ ThirdWeb SDK: For smart contract deployment & automation triggers

‚úÖ Custom GPT or AI Agents: To maintain conversations, pass templates, and handle NLP input

Format Suggestion (per automation template):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "automation_name": "Grant Milestone Release",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "proposal_approved",
    "condition": "proposal.type == 'milestone'"
