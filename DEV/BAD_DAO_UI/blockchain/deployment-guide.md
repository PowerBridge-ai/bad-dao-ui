## üîê Security Considerations

### Pre-Deployment Security Measures

1. **Contract Audit**
   - Complete formal audit by reputable firm
   - Address all critical and high severity findings
   - Document any accepted risks
   - Conduct follow-up audit for significant changes

2. **Multisig Setup**
   - Configure multisig wallets for all admin functions
   - Minimum 3-of-5 signatures for mainnet operations
   - Distribute keys to separate trusted individuals
   - Test multisig functionality on testnet

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control system
   - Timelock all privileged operations
   - Ensure proper permission hierarchies
   - Document all privileged roles and capabilities

### Security Configurations

| Role | Access Level | Timelock | Multisig Required | Notes |
|------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| DAO Admin | Highest | 48 hours | Yes (3/5) | Core protocol parameters |
| Guardian | Emergency | None | Yes (2/3) | Emergency pause only |
| Treasury Manager | Medium | 24 hours | Yes (2/3) | Asset allocation |
| Operator | Low | None | No | Daily operations |

## üìä Contract Addresses

### Mainnet Contracts

| Contract | Address | Implementation | Proxy Admin |
