## üîç Overview

This document outlines the Git workflow and contribution guidelines for the BAD DAO UI project. It defines branching strategies, commit conventions, pull request processes, and release management procedures to ensure consistent and high-quality code contributions.

## üéØ Purpose

The Git workflow documentation aims to:
- Establish a consistent branching strategy
- Define commit message conventions
- Document the pull request and code review process
- Outline release procedures and versioning
- Provide guidance for common Git operations
- Ensure code quality and project stability

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### Main Branches

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit
   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit
   branch feature/auth
   checkout feature/auth
   commit
   commit
   checkout develop
   merge feature/auth
   branch release/v1.0
   checkout release/v1.0
   commit
   checkout main
   merge release/v1.0 tag: "v1.0.0"
   checkout develop
   merge main
   branch hotfix/login
   checkout hotfix/login
   commit
   checkout main
   merge hotfix/login tag: "v1.0.1"
   checkout develop
   merge main
```

| Branch | Purpose | Created From | Merged To | Naming Convention |
|--------|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `main` | Production code | - | - | - |
| `develop` | Integration branch | `main` | `main` | - |
| `feature/*` | New features | `develop` | `develop` | `feature/feature-name` |
| `bugfix/*` | Non-critical fixes | `develop` | `develop` | `bugfix/issue-description` |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | `develop` | `main` & `develop` | `release/vX.Y.Z` |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical fixes | `main` | `main` & `develop` | `hotfix/issue-description` |

### Branch Protection Rules

1. **`main` branch**:
   - Requires pull request review before merging
   - Requires status checks to pass
   - Prohibits force pushes
   - Restricts deletions

2. **`develop` branch**:
   - Requires pull request review before merging
   - Requires status checks to pass
   - Allows force pushes by administrators
   - Restricts deletions

3. **`release/*` branches**:
   - Requires pull request review before merging
   - Requires status checks to pass

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow

### Standard Feature Development Flow

    participant Feature
    participant Develop
    participant CI
    participant PR
    participant Main
    
    Developer->>Develop: Pull latest changes
    Developer->>Feature: Create feature branch
    
    loop Development
        Developer->>Feature: Make changes
        Developer->>Feature: Commit
        Developer->>Feature: Push
        Feature->>CI: Trigger CI checks
        CI-->>Developer: Feedback
    end
    
    Developer->>Develop: Rebase from develop
    Developer->>PR: Create Pull Request
    PR->>CI: Run CI checks
    CI-->>PR: Pass/Fail
    
    Note over PR: Code Review
    
    PR->>Develop: Merge
    Develop->>CI: Trigger integration tests
    
    Note over Develop: Release cycle
    
    Develop->>Main: Release process
```

### Steps for Feature Development

1. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on develop branch
   git checkout develop
   
   # Pull latest changes
   git pull origin develop
   
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. **Development**:
   ```bash
   # Make changes and commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
   
   # Push to remote
   git push -u origin feature/feature-name
   ```

3. **Stay Updated**:
   ```bash
   # Fetch latest changes from develop
   git fetch origin develop
   
   # Rebase your feature branch
   git rebase origin/develop
   
   # If conflicts, resolve them and continue
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   
   # Force push if you've already pushed your branch
   git push -f origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. **Complete Feature**:
   - Create a pull request from `feature/feature-name` to `develop`
   - Address review comments
   - Ensure CI checks pass
   - Get approval and merge

### Handling Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When merge conflicts occur during rebase
git rebase origin/develop

# If conflicts appear:
# 1. Resolve conflicts in your editor
# 2. Add resolved files
git add <resolved-files>

# 3. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# 4. Force push if necessary
git push -f origin feature/feature-name
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Conventional Commits Format

The BAD DAO UI project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests |
| `chore` | Changes to build process or auxiliary tools |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration |

#### Scopes

Scopes specify the area of the codebase affected:

- `auth` - Authentication components
- `gov` - Governance features
- `ui` - UI components
- `api` - API integration
- `contracts` - Smart contract integration
- `deps` - Dependencies
- `config` - Configuration

#### Examples

```
feat(auth): add wallet connection dialog

fix(gov): resolve proposal creation error when token balance is low

docs(api): update API documentation with new endpoints

refactor(ui): reorganize component structure for better maintainability

test(contracts): add tests for voting mechanism
```

### Commit Best Practices

1. **Atomic commits**:
   - Each commit should represent a single logical change
   - Don't mix unrelated changes in a single commit

2. **Complete description**:
   - Use imperative mood in the description ("add" not "added")
   - Keep first line under 72 characters
   - Provide more detail in the body if needed

3. **References**:
   - Reference issues with `#issue-number` in commit message
   - Use footers for breaking changes or issue closing:
     ```
     feat(api): change response format for proposals

     BREAKING CHANGE: Proposal API now returns a different structure

     Closes #123
     ```

4. **Tools**:
   - Use `commitizen` for standardized commits
   - Set up a commit message template to ensure consistency

### Pull Request Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Create PR
    Draft --> Open: Ready for Review
    Open --> Changes_Requested: Review
    Changes_Requested --> Open: Address Comments
    Open --> Approved: Approve
    Approved --> Merged: Merge
    Merged --> [*]
```

### Code Review Guidelines

#### For Authors

1. **Keep PRs focused**:
   - Limit to 500 lines of changes when possible
   - Split large features into smaller PRs
   - Use draft PRs for work in progress

2. **Self-review**:
   - Review your own changes before requesting review
   - Use GitHub's "Files changed" view to catch issues
   - Run linters and tests locally before pushing

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Use suggestions where appropriate
   - Explain any disagreements respectfully

#### For Reviewers

1. **Review scope**:
   - Code correctness and functionality
   - Adherence to project standards
   - Security implications
   - Performance considerations
   - Test coverage

2. **Constructive feedback**:
   - Be specific about issues
   - Suggest solutions when possible
   - Use GitHub suggestions for small changes
   - Distinguish between required changes and preferences

3. **Approval criteria**:
   - All required changes addressed
   - Tests pass
   - Code meets quality standards
   - Documentation is updated

### Merging Strategy

The project uses **Squash and Merge** as the primary merge strategy:

- **Squash and Merge**: Combines all PR commits into a single commit on the target branch
  - Keeps history clean and linear
  - Commit message becomes the PR title and description
  - Feature branch history is preserved in the PR

In special cases (e.g., large features with well-structured commits), **Rebase and Merge** can be used:

- **Rebase and Merge**: Applies individual commits to the target branch
  - Preserves detailed commit history
  - Should only be used when commit history provides valuable context

```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflows:

1. **Pull Request Checks**:
   - Triggered on PR creation/update
   - Runs linting, tests, and builds
   - Generates deploy previews
   - Performs security scans

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Triggered on pushes to `develop` and feature branches
   - Runs comprehensive test suite
   - Performs code quality checks
   - Updates status badges

3. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Triggered on merges to `develop` and `main`
   - Builds and deploys to staging/production
   - Runs post-deployment verification
   - Generates deployment reports

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```

### Useful Git Commands

#### Branch Management

```bash
# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name

# Rename current branch
git branch -m new-name
```

#### Syncing & History

```bash
# Fetch remote changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Rebase current branch on another
git rebase branch-name

# Interactive rebase for cleaning history
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# View commit history
git log --graph --oneline --decorate
```

#### Working with Remote

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin url

# Change remote URL
git remote set-url origin new-url

# List remote repositories
git remote -v

# Fetch specific branch
git fetch origin branch-name

# Push force with lease (safer than force push)
git push --force-with-lease origin branch-name
```

### Git Hooks

The project uses Git hooks to enforce standards:

1. **pre-commit**: Runs linting and formatting
2. **commit-msg**: Validates commit message format
3. **pre-push**: Runs tests before pushing

Example commit-msg hook:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat $COMMIT_MSG_FILE)

# Regex for conventional commits
PATTERN="^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore|ci|build|revert)(\([a-z-]+\))?!?: .+$"

if ! [[ $COMMIT_MSG =~ $PATTERN ]]; then
  echo "Error: Commit message does not follow conventional commits format."
  echo "Example: feat(ui): add new button component"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Recommended Git Tools

- **GitHub Desktop**: Visual Git client
- **GitLens**: VS Code extension for Git
- **Husky**: Git hooks automation
- **Commitizen**: Interactive commit message creation
- **Git Kraken**: Git GUI client
