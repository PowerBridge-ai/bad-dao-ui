## 🌐 Environment Configuration

The application is deployed across multiple environments, each with specific purposes and configurations.

### Environment Overview

| Environment | Purpose | URL | Access | Update Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----|--------|------------------|
| Development | Feature testing, integration testing | https://dev.baddao.io | Team only | Continuous |
| Staging | UAT, pre-release testing | https://staging.baddao.io | Team & stakeholders | Weekly/As needed |
| Production | Live application | https://app.baddao.io | Public | Scheduled releases |

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Each environment uses configuration values specific to its purpose, controlled through environment variables and build parameters.

#### Development Environment

```javascript
// .env.development example
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api-dev.baddao.io
REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=goerli
REACT_APP_RPC_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
REACT_APP_EXPLORER_URL=https://goerli.etherscan.io
REACT_APP_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=0x1234...dev
REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x5678...dev
REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS={"newGovernance":true,"treasuryV2":true}
```

#### Staging Environment

```javascript
// .env.staging example
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=staging
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api-staging.baddao.io
REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=sepolia
REACT_APP_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
REACT_APP_EXPLORER_URL=https://sepolia.etherscan.io
REACT_APP_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=0x1234...staging
REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x5678...staging
REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS={"newGovernance":true,"treasuryV2":false}
```

#### Production Environment

```javascript
// .env.production example
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.baddao.io
REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=mainnet
REACT_APP_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
REACT_APP_EXPLORER_URL=https://etherscan.io
REACT_APP_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=0x1234...prod
REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x5678...prod
REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS={"newGovernance":false,"treasuryV2":false}
```

### Secret Management

Sensitive configuration values (API keys, private endpoints) are managed through AWS Secrets Manager and are not stored in the codebase.

```bash
# Example of fetching secrets during build
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id baddao/production/api-keys --query SecretString --output text > .env.production.local
```

## 📦 Build Process

The build process transforms the source code into optimized, deployable artifacts specific to each environment.

### Build Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or later
- npm v8 or later
- Access to the GitHub repository
- AWS credentials (for deployment)
- Environment-specific configuration files

### Build Steps

    style F,G,H,I fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Build Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# build.sh - Build script for BAD DAO UI

# Set environment
ENV=${1:-production}
echo "Building for environment: $ENV"

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run linters and tests
npm run lint
npm test -- --watchAll=false

# Build application with environment-specific config
npm run build:$ENV

# Optimize assets (images, SVGs)
npm run optimize-assets

# Generate build report
npm run analyze-bundle

# Archive artifacts
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
tar -czf build-$ENV-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz build/

echo "Build completed for $ENV environment"
```

### Build Artifacts

The build process generates the following artifacts:

- **Static Files**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets
- **Asset Manifest**: JSON file mapping original filenames to hash-versioned filenames
- **Bundle Analysis Report**: Visual representation of bundle sizes and dependencies
- **Build Metadata**: JSON file containing build timestamp, version, and environment

### Environment Injection

Environment-specific values are injected during the build process, resulting in environment-specific builds. Feature flags, API endpoints, and blockchain configurations are embedded in the build.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment of the application across environments.

## ⏪ Rollback Procedures

In case of critical issues, rollback procedures ensure quick recovery to a stable state.

### Automated Rollback

The CI/CD pipeline includes automated rollback capabilities triggered by failed verification:

```yaml
# Excerpt from GitHub Actions workflow
jobs:
  verify-deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: deploy-production
    steps:
      # ... verification steps ...
      - name: Check verification results
        id: check
        run: |
          if [ -f verification-failed ]; then
            echo "::set-output name=rollback::true"
            exit 1
          fi
          
  rollback:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: verify-deployment
    if: failure() && needs.verify-deployment.outputs.rollback == 'true'
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Download previous version
        run: aws s3 cp s3://baddao-backup/production/previous-version.tar.gz ./previous-version.tar.gz
      - name: Extract previous version
        run: tar -xzf previous-version.tar.gz
      - name: Deploy previous version
        run: aws s3 sync previous-version/ s3://baddao-ui-production --delete
      - name: Invalidate CloudFront
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.PROD_CLOUDFRONT_ID }} --paths "/*"
      - name: Notify rollback
        run: |
          curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"⚠️ ALERT: Production deployment failed, rollback initiated"}' ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### Manual Rollback Procedure

For situations where automated rollback fails:

1. **Access the backup artifacts**

```bash
# List available backups
aws s3 ls s3://baddao-backup/production/
```

2. **Download and extract the desired version**

```bash
# Download specific version
aws s3 cp s3://baddao-backup/production/build-production-[TIMESTAMP].tar.gz ./rollback-version.tar.gz

# Extract files
tar -xzf rollback-version.tar.gz
```

3. **Deploy the rollback version**

```bash
# Deploy to S3
aws s3 sync rollback-version/ s3://baddao-ui-production --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id PRODUCTION_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

4. **Verify the rollback**

```bash
# Check deployed version
curl -s https://app.baddao.io/version.json
```

5. **Document the rollback**

```bash
# Create rollback record
echo "Rollback performed at $(date) to version $(cat rollback-version/version.json | jq -r .buildId)" > rollback-record.txt
aws s3 cp rollback-record.txt s3://baddao-backup/production/rollbacks/
```

// Sample alert configuration
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "name": "High Error Rate",
      "metric": "error_rate",
      "threshold": 0.01,
      "duration": "5m",
      "severity": "critical",
      "channels": ["slack-dev", "pagerduty"],
      "message": "Error rate exceeded 1% for 5 minutes - Please investigate immediately",
      "runbook": "https://docs.internal/runbooks/high-error-rate"
    },
    {
      "name": "Slow Page Load",
      "metric": "page_load_time_p90",
      "threshold": 3.0,
      "duration": "10m",
      "severity": "medium",
      "channels": ["slack-dev"],
      "message": "Page load time (p90) exceeding 3 seconds for 10 minutes",
      "runbook": "https://docs.internal/runbooks/slow-page-load"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

After each deployment, heightened monitoring is enabled:

- Reduced alert thresholds for the first hour
- Increased metric sampling rate
- Real-time dashboard monitoring
- Automated comparison with pre-deployment baseline

### Error Budget

The system operates with an error budget defining the acceptable level of errors:

- 99.9% availability target
- 0.1% error budget per month
- Budget depletion triggers deployment freeze
- Budget reset at the start of each month

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

Security is integrated into the deployment process to protect the application and infrastructure.

### Security Scanning

Pre-deployment security scans include:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure as Code security analysis
- Secret detection

```yaml
# Security scanning job in CI/CD pipeline
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Scan for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      - name: Check for secrets
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Scan infrastructure
        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: infrastructure/
```

### Secure Configuration Management

- Environment variables are encrypted at rest
- Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- Access to secrets is restricted by IAM roles
- Sensitive values are never logged or exposed

### Infrastructure Security

- S3 buckets configured with appropriate access policies
- CloudFront distributions use HTTPS only
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- SSL certificates with strong cipher suites

### Secure Deployment Practices

- Least privilege principle for deployment roles
- Multi-factor authentication for production deployments
- Signed commits and code reviews required
- Immutable deployments with versioned artifacts
