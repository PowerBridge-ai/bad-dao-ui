# üîß Development Notes

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Implementation

### Browser Storage Implementation
- Implementation uses localStorage for storing space data in the browser
- Key design:
  ```javascript
  const STORAGE_KEY = 'bad_dao_spaces';
  ```
- Data is serialized to JSON for storage and deserialized on retrieval
- Handles date conversion for proper Date object representation

### üìä Data Models
- Space:
  ```typescript
  export interface Space {
    id?: string;
    name: string;
    creator: string;
    description: string;
    categories: string[];
    isPublic: boolean;
    createdAt?: Date;
    logo?: string;
    proposalCount?: number;
    voteCount?: number;
  }
  ```

## üé® UI Improvements

### 3D Background Animation
- Reduced rotation speed from 0.1 to 0.02 for smoother appearance
- Added damping factor of 0.7 seconds for transitions
- Increased object spread from 10 to 15 units for better zoom
- Moved FloatingTitle to the left side `[-2, 2, 0]` for better mobile visibility

### Form Improvements
- Increased form container width from max-w-xl to max-w-2xl
- Added transition easing: `transition={{ duration: 0.7, ease: "easeInOut" }}`
- Fixed visibility toggle buttons to properly show both options
- Added error handling UI for database operations

## üì± Mobile Considerations
- Positioned FloatingTitle on the left side to ensure visibility on mobile
- Improved camera position and controls for better mobile experience
- Added responsive width adjustments for form container

## üîÑ API Integration
- Created localStorage-based database service with CRUD operations
- Added automatic fallback to mock data when localStorage operations fail
- Implemented space creation flow that persists to localStorage 

## üñ•Ô∏è Canvas UI Improvements

### Node Editor Enhancements
- Enhanced the "Add Node" button for better visibility:
  - Repositioned to be more prominent in the UI
  - Added hover animation effects
  - Improved contrast for better accessibility
  
### Node Display Fixes
- Fixed issue where non-token nodes appeared as white squares
- Implemented custom components for all node types:
  - TokenNode - For ERC-20 tokens with supply, symbol, decimals
  - GovernorNode - For governance contracts with voting period, quorum
  - TreasuryNode - For treasury management with multi-sig support
  - TimelockNode - For execution delays with customizable timeframes
  - AiNode - For AI integration with model specifications
  - VestingNode - For token vesting with period and cliff settings
  - DelegationNode - For voting delegation with delegation parameters
- Each node type has:
  - Distinctive colorization based on type
  - Appropriate icon (using Lucide icons)
  - Custom form fields in the properties modal
  - Type-specific validation
- Node creation process now properly maps node types to components
- Type-specific default values are applied to new nodes
- Node properties modal renders appropriate fields based on node type

### Chat Interface Integration
- Extended ChatInterface command processing:
  - Added support for natural language node operations
  - Implemented command processing through NodeEditorRef
  - Added visual feedback for node creation/modification operations
  - Improved handling of voice commands for node management
  
### Wizard-Canvas Integration
- Streamlined the integration between Wizard steps and canvas nodes:
  - Consolidated node creation logic
  - Added visual indicators when nodes are created from wizard steps
  - Implemented better state management for node tracking
  - Improved feedback when wizard actions affect the canvas

### Voice Command Processing
- Enhanced the voice command system:
  - Added specific node management keywords
  - Improved context awareness for operations
  - Implemented confirmation feedback for voice-triggered actions
  - Added voice playback for command confirmations

### Performance Optimizations
- Improved canvas rendering performance:
  - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
  - Optimized node positioning calculations
  - Enhanced edge rendering for complex node connections
  - Improved zoom and pan behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

### ElevenLabs Integration
- Fixed error handling in voice synthesis:
  - Added proper error handling for 401 Unauthorized responses
  - Implemented state cleanup after API failures to prevent UI lockup
  - Added checks for API key and voice ID before attempting playback
  - Refactored service to use class-based approach with better error isolation
  - Improved Promise handling with proper catch/finally blocks
  - Prevented automatic voice recording start when playback fails
- Improved Node Management button behavior:
  - Added conditional voice playback based on API key availability
  - Implemented independent chat message display from voice synthesis
  - Added visual feedback that works even when voice synthesis fails
