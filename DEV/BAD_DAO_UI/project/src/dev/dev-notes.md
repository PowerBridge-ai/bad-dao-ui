# 🔧 Development Notes

## 🗄️ Database Implementation

### Browser Storage Implementation
- Implementation uses localStorage for storing space data in the browser
- Key design:
  ```javascript
  const STORAGE_KEY = 'bad_dao_spaces';
  ```
- Data is serialized to JSON for storage and deserialized on retrieval
- Handles date conversion for proper Date object representation

### 📊 Data Models
- Space:
  ```typescript
  export interface Space {
    id?: string;
    name: string;
    creator: string;
    description: string;
    categories: string[];
    isPublic: boolean;
    createdAt?: Date;
    logo?: string;
    proposalCount?: number;
    voteCount?: number;
  }
  ```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### 3D Background Animation
- Reduced rotation speed from 0.1 to 0.02 for smoother appearance
- Added damping factor of 0.7 seconds for transitions
- Increased object spread from 10 to 15 units for better zoom
- Moved FloatingTitle to the left side `[-2, 2, 0]` for better mobile visibility

### Form Improvements
- Increased form container width from max-w-xl to max-w-2xl
- Added transition easing: `transition={{ duration: 0.7, ease: "easeInOut" }}`
- Fixed visibility toggle buttons to properly show both options
- Added error handling UI for database operations

## 📱 Mobile Considerations
- Positioned FloatingTitle on the left side to ensure visibility on mobile
- Improved camera position and controls for better mobile experience
- Added responsive width adjustments for form container

## 🔄 API Integration
- Created localStorage-based database service with CRUD operations
- Added automatic fallback to mock data when localStorage operations fail
- Implemented space creation flow that persists to localStorage
