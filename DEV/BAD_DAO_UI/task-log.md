## Task Update - [May 7, 2025]

### 🟢 ElevenLabs API Error Handling Improvements
Fixed issues with UI disappearing when clicking Node Management button due to ElevenLabs API errors.

#### Changes Made
- ✅ Fixed `elevenlabsService.ts` with proper error handling
  - Added early validation to prevent unnecessary API calls
  - Improved error handling for authentication errors
  - Reset state properly when errors occur
  - Added better promise rejection pattern
  - Added `hasApiKey` method to check for valid API keys
  
- ✅ Fixed `Governance.tsx` React DOM errors
  - Replaced direct DOM manipulation with React state management
  - Created `showListeningIndicator` state to safely control UI visibility
  - Added API key validation on component mount
  - Improved error resilience in speech component
  
#### Technical Details
The main issue was caused by direct DOM manipulation with `removeChild()` that was trying to remove nodes that were already gone, causing React to throw DOM errors. This happened when the ElevenLabs API returned a 401 Unauthorized error.

#### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing a fallback voice service when ElevenLabs is not available
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for network issues 

## Task Progress - [2023-08-09]

- ✅ Replaced direct DOM manipulation with React state management for voice indicators
- ✅ Improved error handling for ElevenLabs API integration
- ✅ Added proper cleanup in component lifecycle functions
- ✅ Fixed code preview modal using React state instead of direct DOM manipulation

#### Technical Metrics
- Error reduction: Eliminated "Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'" errors
- Improved code maintainability with proper React patterns
- Enhanced error resilience for voice recognition/synthesis features

#### Next Steps
1. Add better error boundaries around speech recognition components
2. Consider implementing a global audio management service
3. Improve mobile support for voice interaction features 

## Task Progress - [2023-08-10]

### Current Implementation
🎯 Task: Add Voice Settings UI and Debug Logging
📊 Progress: 100%

#### Changes Made
- ✅ Created structured debug logger utility in utils/logger.ts
  - Implemented emoji-based logging following structured-debug-logging-guide.md
  - Added variable verbosity levels (1-3) controlled via localStorage
  - Created specialized logging functions for UI, API, voice operations
- ✅ Enhanced elevenlabsService with comprehensive debug logging
  - Added detailed API request/response logging
  - Improved error handling with contextual information
  - Implemented performance timing for API operations
- ✅ Added Voice Settings modal to Governance component
  - Created UI for ElevenLabs API key configuration

  - Added proper state persistence to localStorage

#### Technical Metrics
- Debug visibility: Added 50+ log points across components
- Error resilience: Improved error detection with context-rich logs
- UX improvement: Added missing configuration UI for voice features
- Voice functionality: Fixed "ElevenLabs API key not configured" errors

#### Next Steps
1. Add persistent logging to debug storage for session replay
2. Implement log filtering by component and severity
3. Add network request/response logging for all API calls
4. Create a debug panel for viewing logs in the application

#### Implementation Details
The new Voice Settings modal provides a simple interface for users to:
1. Enter their ElevenLabs API key
2. Load and select available voices
3. Test the selected voice
4. Save settings to localStorage

This resolves the "ElevenLabs not configured" errors previously seen in the console logs and ensures proper voice feedback throughout the application.
