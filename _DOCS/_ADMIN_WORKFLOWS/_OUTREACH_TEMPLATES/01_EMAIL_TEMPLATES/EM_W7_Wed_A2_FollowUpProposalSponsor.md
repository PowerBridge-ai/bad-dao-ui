Subject: Following Up: Build A DAO Sponsorship Opportunities & [Sponsor Company Name]

Dear [Sponsor Contact Name],

I hope you're having a good week.

I am writing to gently follow up on the Build A DAO sponsorship [package/proposal] I sent to you on [Date Package/Proposal Was Sent]. We are very excited about the potential of partnering with [Sponsor Company Name] to [mention a key mutual benefit, e.g., "enhance your brand's presence in the Web3 community" or "support the growth of innovative decentralized projects"].

We understand that you have many items on your agenda, and we wanted to ensure the information reached you and to see if you've had a chance for an initial review or have any immediate questions.

If you've reviewed it, we'd be keen to hear your thoughts or schedule a brief call to discuss how we can best align our sponsorship offerings with your objectives. If this isn't the right time or opportunity for [Sponsor Company Name], we would appreciate knowing that too.

Please let me know if there's a suitable time for a quick conversation next week.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, Build A DAO
