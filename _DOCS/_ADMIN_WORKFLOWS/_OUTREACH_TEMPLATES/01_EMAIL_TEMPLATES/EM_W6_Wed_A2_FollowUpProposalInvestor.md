Subject: Following Up: Build A DAO Pitch Deck - [Investor Firm Name]

Dear [Investor Contact Name],

I hope this email finds you well and you've had a productive week.

I'm writing to gently follow up on the Build A DAO pitch deck I sent to you on [Date Deck Was Sent]. We are very enthusiastic about the potential for [Investor Firm Name] to partner with us as we [mention key strategic goal, e.g., "scale our platform to serve more DAOs" or "pioneer new governance models"].

We understand that you review many opportunities, and we wanted to ensure our materials reached you and to see if you had any initial thoughts or questions after a preliminary look.

If you've had a chance to review it, I would welcome the opportunity to connect briefly to discuss it further. Alternatively, if this isn't the right fit or timing for [Investor Firm Name], we would certainly appreciate that feedback as well.

Please let me know if there's a good time for a quick chat next week.

Thank you for your continued consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, Build A DAO
