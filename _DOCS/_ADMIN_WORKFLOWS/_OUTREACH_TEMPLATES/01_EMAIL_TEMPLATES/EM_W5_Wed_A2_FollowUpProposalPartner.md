Subject: Following Up: Partnership Proposal - [Build A DAO] & [Partner Name]

Dear [Partner Contact Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to gently follow up on the partnership proposal I sent over on [Date Proposal Was Sent] regarding a potential collaboration between [Build A DAO] and [Partner Name].

We understand you have many priorities, and we wanted to ensure you had a chance to review it. We remain very enthusiastic about the prospect of working together to [reiterate 1-2 key benefits/goals from the proposal, e.g., "co-develop innovative DAO tooling" or "expand our reach within the Web3 developer community"].

Would you have some time next week for a brief chat to discuss the proposal or answer any initial questions you might have? Please let me know what works best for you.

If you've already reviewed it and have feedback, or if it's not the right time, we'd appreciate knowing that as well.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, Build A DAO
[Your Contact Information]
[Link to Build A DAO Website]
```

## üìå Best Practices
1.  Maintain a polite, patient, and professional tone.
2.  Refer to the date the original proposal was sent for context.
3.  Briefly reiterate the core value proposition of the partnership.
4.  Offer a clear call to action (e.g., a brief chat).
5.  Indicate openness to feedback, even if it's a polite declination, to encourage a response.
6.  Avoid accusatory language or making the recipient feel pressured.

## üîÑ Follow-up Action
- If there's still no response after this follow-up, consider one final, very brief check-in after another 5-7 days, or an alternative contact method if appropriate and available (e.g., a mutual connection).
- Update the CRM with the follow-up attempt.
- If a negative response is received, handle it professionally and explore if a future connection might be possible.

## üìä Success Metrics
- Response rate to this follow-up email.
- Success in scheduling a discussion about the proposal.
- Clarity on the partner's interest level (positive, negative, or needs more time).
