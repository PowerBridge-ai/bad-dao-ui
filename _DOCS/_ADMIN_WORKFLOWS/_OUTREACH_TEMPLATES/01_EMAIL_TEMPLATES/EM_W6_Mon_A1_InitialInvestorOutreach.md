## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Points
- `[Investor Contact Name]`: The specific contact at the firm (e.g., Partner, Analyst).
- `[Catchy Hook]`: A short, compelling phrase related to your value proposition.
- `[1-2 sentence compelling mission statement]`: Your elevator pitch.
- `[Investor Firm Name]`: Name of the investment firm.
- `[mention their specific investment thesis, portfolio company, or area of interest]`: CRITICAL for personalization.
- `[mention 1-2 key traction points/milestones]`: Quantifiable achievements if possible.
- `[Your Name]`: Your full name.
- `[Your Contact Information]`: Your email, and optionally LinkedIn.
- `[Link to Build A DAO Website/LinkedIn Profile]`: Essential links.

## üìå Best Practices
1.  **Deep Research**: Thoroughly research each investor and their firm to personalize the outreach. Generic emails have very low success rates.
2.  **Conciseness**: Investors are busy. Keep the email short and to the point.
3.  **Clear Ask**: Be specific about what you want (a call or permission to send a deck).
4.  **Strong Subject Line**: Make it compelling and informative.
5.  **Credibility**: Mentioning traction or key milestones briefly can increase interest.
6.  **Referral First**: If you can get a warm introduction, always prefer that over a cold email.
7.  **Typos**: Proofread meticulously. Errors reflect poorly.

## üîÑ Follow-up Action
- If no response to Option A or B within 4-5 business days, use `EM_W6_Mon_A2_FollowUpInvestor.md`.
- If they agree to a call, use `EM_W6_Mon_A3_MeetingSchedulingInvestor.md`.
- If they agree to see the deck, use `EM_W1_Wed_A2_SendInvestorDeck.md`.
- Track all outreach in your CRM or investor pipeline tool.

## üìä Success Metrics
- Positive response rate (agreement to call/see deck).
- Open rates (if your email tool tracks this).
