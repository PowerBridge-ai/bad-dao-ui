# üìß Follow-Up Investor Email (No Response)

**ID:** EM_W6_Mon_A2_FollowUpInvestor
**Reference:** Calendar: W6_Mon_A2 (Follow up on responses - Investor)

## üìù Template Purpose
To gently follow up with a potential investor if no response was received from the initial outreach email (`EM_W6_Mon_A1_InitialInvestorOutreach.md`).

## üéØ Context
Used 4-5 business days after the initial investor outreach if there has been no reply. The goal is to provide another opportunity for engagement without being overly persistent.

Subject: Following Up: Build A DAO - Investment Opportunity

Dear [Investor Contact Name],

I hope your week is going well.

I am writing to briefly follow up on my previous email sent on [Date of Initial Email] regarding Build A DAO and our work in [briefly reiterate your specific area, e.g., "enhancing DAO operational efficiency"].

We understand you receive many emails, so I wanted to ensure ours didn't get lost in the shuffle. We believe Build A DAO presents a unique opportunity within the [mention their focus area, e.g., "Web3 infrastructure space"] that aligns with [Investor Firm Name]'s investment strategy.

[Optional: Add a brief, newsworthy update if available since the last email, e.g., "Since my last note, we've [achieved X small milestone/received Y positive feedback]."]

Would you be open to a quick 15-20 minute chat sometime next week to explore this further, or alternatively, may I share our pitch deck for your review at your convenience?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Founder, Build A DAO

## üìå Best Practices
1.  **Politeness is Key**: Maintain a respectful and understanding tone.
2.  **Brevity**: Even shorter than the first email.
3.  **Add Value (Optional)**: If there's a small, relevant update, it can be a good reason to follow up.
4.  **Reiterate the Ask Clearly**: Offer both a call or to send the deck as options.
5.  **Timing**: Don't follow up too soon or too aggressively. One follow-up is often sufficient for a cold outreach if there's no reply.

## üîÑ Follow-up Action
- If they respond positively to a call, use `EM_W6_Mon_A3_MeetingSchedulingInvestor.md`.
- If they agree to see the deck, use `EM_W1_Wed_A2_SendInvestorDeck.md`.
- If there is still no response after this email, it's generally best to move on and focus efforts elsewhere, unless there's a very strong reason or another angle (like a future mutual connection) to try much later.
- Update CRM/tracker.

## üìä Success Metrics
- Response rate to this follow-up.
- Conversion to a call or deck review request.
