Subject: Scheduling Our Discussion: Build A DAO Sponsorship & [Sponsor Company Name]

Dear [Sponsor Contact Name],

Thank you for your interest in discussing sponsorship opportunities with Build A DAO. We're excited to explore how we can partner with [Sponsor Company Name] for [mention specific event/initiative if discussed, or "mutual benefit" if general].

I'm available for a [e.g., 20-30 minute] call at the following times next week:
*   [Date 1]: [Time Slot A], [Time Slot B] ([Your Time Zone])
*   [Date 2]: [Time Slot C], [Time Slot D] ([Your Time Zone])
*   [Date 3]: [Time Slot E], [Time Slot F] ([Your Time Zone])

Please let me know which of these times works best for you. If none of these are suitable, please suggest a time that is, or feel free to share your scheduling link.

Once a time is confirmed, I will send a calendar invitation with the [Video Conference Link] and a brief agenda for our conversation.

[Optional: If the sponsorship package hasn't been sent or for easy reference: "I've (re)attached our sponsorship package for your convenience."]

We look forward to connecting with you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
