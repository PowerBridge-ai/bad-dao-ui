**Reference:** Calendar: W1_Tue_A2 (Create platform-specific templates); Guide: Social Media Strategy

## üìù Template Purpose
To provide a general framework and examples for creating engaging social media posts tailored to different platforms (Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn, Telegram) as outlined in the Founder Outreach Guide.

## üéØ Context

*   **Visuals:** Use high-quality images, GIFs, or short videos where appropriate to increase engagement.
*   **Hashtags:** Use relevant and targeted hashtags (especially on Twitter & LinkedIn) but don't overdo it.
*   **Conciseness:** Get to the point quickly.
*   **Engagement:** Ask questions, run polls, respond to comments promptly.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a regular posting schedule.
*   **Brand Voice:** Ensure posts align with Build A DAO's overall brand voice (e.g., innovative, supportive, community-focused).
*   **Track Performance:** Monitor metrics to see what resonates and adjust strategy accordingly.
