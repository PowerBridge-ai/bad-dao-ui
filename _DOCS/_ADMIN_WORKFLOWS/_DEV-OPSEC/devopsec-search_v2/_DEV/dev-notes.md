## üìù Technical Decisions Log

### Decision: Google Sheets as Database
- **ID**: DEC-001
- **Context**: Need a simple, accessible storage solution that doesn't require server setup
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Firebase Firestore
  2. LocalStorage with export
  3. Google Sheets
- **Decision**: Google Sheets
- **Rationale**: 
  - No server required
  - Accessible from anywhere
  - Built-in access control
  - Easy to view/edit manually if needed
  - Simple API with good TypeScript support
- **Implications**: 
  - Rate limiting considerations
  - Need to handle offline scenarios
  - Data structure limitations
- **Status**: Implemented

### Decision: TypeScript for Backend
- **ID**: DEC-002
- **Context**: Need a type-safe language compatible with frontend
- **Options Considered**:
  1. JavaScript
  2. TypeScript
- **Decision**: TypeScript
- **Rationale**: 
  - Type safety
  - Code completion
  - Better error detection
  - Shared types with frontend
- **Implications**: 
  - Additional build step
  - Type definitions maintenance
- **Status**: Implemented

### Decision: Service Design Pattern
- **ID**: DEC-003
- **Context**: Need an organized approach to backend functionality
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Single monolithic module
  2. Service-based architecture
  3. Class-based modules
- **Decision**: Service-based architecture with classes
- **Rationale**: 
  - Better organization
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easier testing
  - Dependency injection support
- **Implications**: 
  - Need to maintain service relationships
  - Potential for circular dependencies
- **Status**: Implemented

## üîß Implementation Details

### Google Sheets Client
The Google Sheets client is implemented as a class that handles all interactions with the Google Sheets API. It provides methods for:
- Reading data from sheets
- Writing data to sheets
- Appending data to sheets
- Batch updating multiple ranges
- Creating new sheets
- Initializing sheet structure

This client abstracts away the complexity of the Google Sheets API and provides a simple interface for the other services.

### Service Dependencies
Services are designed with dependency injection to improve testability. The services have the following dependencies:

1. **SheetsClient**: No dependencies
2. **AdminService**: SheetsClient
3. **PlatformService**: SheetsClient
4. **ScanService**: SheetsClient
5. **MetricsService**: SheetsClient, ScanService, PlatformService
6. **ExportService**: ScanService

This dependency structure allows for easy mocking during testing and provides a clear organization of the code.
