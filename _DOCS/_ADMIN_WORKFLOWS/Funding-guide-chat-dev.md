I need a strategy and a playbook for taking the two web 3 blockchain projects that I do have and getting funding so this is a funding guide and so strategy number one reach out to protocols blockchain projects like optimism base eth lisk xrp ICP Avalanche base polka dot aptos SUI Hadera soul those are just some of the projects So I want to give one of our core team members a guide on how to go and find the projects right by list rank them find a give them a prompt or a search query that will give them the ability to specifically filter out the projects that have hackathons grants or current funding programs with the closest deadlines to right now April 28th 2025 and what we want to do is tell our core team to go ahead and fill out these applications in a structured way so we go find the opportunity for funding we go find the project leads whoever the liaison for that project or that organization is per token and per AI project i'm sorry per blockchain project and then what we want to do is go ahead and get them listed organize put into a Google sheet and begin to build a database of ranked opportunities and So what we want to do is get that list of of projects and protocols put them on that Google sheet get the names of the contacts and then give me a strategy for steps for reaching out to them giving them our documentation our socials what do they call it a blurp And then from there you have whatever project documentation and contact leads from our team that need to be on that documentation or that communication like email or an X .com post or a direct message or LinkedIn the goal is to reach out to those team leads that we know make decisions for funding and project acceptance specifically and ideally for fast track so any path that is fast track funding even if it's for a small amount under 4K right we'll take it in order to be able to facilitate the first growth of our partnership I guess bored where we're on boarding a significant amount of strategic partnerships to build our momentum so can you please wrap this up in a guide after you do research on the Internet to make sure that I'm not crazy and there's a bunch of these companies that actually have these lists already so find me those if they exist if not go ahead and make the list yourself give me a nice table put in a nice formatting the way that I like them

This is an excellent and detailed plan. To create the most effective funding guide and playbook for your two Web3 blockchain projects, could you please clarify a few quick points first:

Could you briefly describe your two blockchain projects (e.g., sector focus like DeFi, AI, NFTs, infrastructure)?

Are you primarily targeting grants, hackathons, accelerator programs, or all types of funding opportunities?

Do you want me to prioritize funding programs with deadlines within the next 60 days (April–June 2025), or a different window?

Should I include only direct blockchain protocol funding (like Optimism grants) or also blockchain ecosystem venture funds (e.g., Polygon Ventures)?

Preferred geographic scope: Global, US-focused, Europe-focused?

Once you confirm, I’ll start the research and build the full guide and database for you!

You said:
OK the first project is for creating on chain traffic for a women's product supply chain in the Kenyan region and so this project basically provides a direct to ship option for women in the region to have access to healthcare products and women's products that they didn't have available before And then there is an ecosystem with the polka dot network to be able to purchase those products with polka dot as well as get discounts from the manufacturers of those women products while using polka dot so it's a it's a little bit more complicated supply streams dealing with the manufacturer directly once you have wholesale pricing and the ability to put discounts on there then we can basically bring in the income ourselves pay the manufacturing by the products and and handle the the logistics a little bit better that's project number one project number two is called Beacon it is a base coin base USD T USDC application that is basically staged one to integrate and coordinate businesses that are offline and online on a Google map and in a database that's easily accessible through the base DAP network and stable coin networks to be able to easily on board businesses for free to be able to take in crypto immediately for their products and transactions so the idea is we would like to on board restaurants 1st as the 1st sector to be able to gain traction and then work with smaller retailers and then eventually bigger retailers and possibly manufacturers to become APOS system where the approach is to send out a mailer to businesses and say hey don't miss the web 3 blockchain bull run be in the mix get your banking done now scan this sign up taken crypto today we're not giving them a wallet that we made we're just helping them set up coin base right and if they want to put their products for sale on our marketplace we get a piece of that so that's one project and then the 3rd one is build a Dow where it is a decentralized autonomous organization that has a smart contract that allows AI powered no code platform for launching and managing decentralized autonomous organizations bad automates Treasury governance and project management enabling an organization to scale transparently efficiently and securely our platform empowers teams to deploy smart contracts manage funds and automate decision making with embedded AI all from a user friendly UI so that's the three projects and then you asked me are you primarily targeting grants hackathons accelerated programs or all types of funding I would like to say all types of funding at this point so we get the exercise you know in the skill within our group and then from there it's a teachable skill that we know like successful routes and patterns and of communication networking and then that kind of thing so I would like you to structure a hierarchy for which one do you think will be more successful and applicable for our projects whether that be the grants the hackathons accelerator programs fast track programs or a mix of whatever combination you feel is appropriate question number three do you want me to prioritize funding programs with deadlines within the next 60 days April June 2025 no that's perfect actually if you can get as close as to April and prioritize those ones with shorter windows and then on the list you can go all the way to you know December 2025 I don't I don't really mind just make sure that it's a deep enough list and we've covered at least the top 20 protocols and blockchain companies and projects that have established funding routes and established funding communities and then we may mix a few in there that have new money that just have successful projects in the last 6 to 12 months that may not even have established grants or some kind of funding program but we have the opportunity to create one with our Dow all right moving forward should I include only direct blockchain protocol funding like optimism grants are also blockchain ecosystem venture funds Polygon ventures II think both I think both is a viable option we do have a structured business I do have AEIN in America Delaware Corporation business account set up through revolute So I think we're good on that end So we can take in both money we can take in VC money and crypto funding money effectively and legally we're all KYC we're all good all our team is verified I don't really have a preferred geographic scope so for question number 5 that you asked me global is fine US focused European focus it's fine I think from a perspective of we're starting from the Kenyan region I think you can prioritize some of those opportunities first but if there is a clear opportunity from a global perspective it's just in another region or in another time zone then it makes sense to prioritize the funding is that's the true goal prioritize the funding practice the skill of doing the research on the opportunity one putting it in a list in the database to evaluating and prioritizing those opportunities and then being able to strategically find and reach out to those decision makers in those projects create a chain of communication whether it's just a hey hey how you doing i'd like you to check out my my telegram or my website or my project whatever it is right whatever the avenue and strategy for that particular individual in their decision making flow explain it explain the logic explain why we're doing this this is a full guide and then also teach them the path of interacting in a passive way where instead of you going to say hey go check out my project guy who gives a lot of money for other projects go find these individuals posts and go like them have their curiosity come find you that is a huge strategy and that brings a lot of business but you have to have a good **** face card when they come looking for you alright anyways my bad excuse my language I think that's good I think it's rounded for what you're asking for I think you have a good strategy I don't need AUII don't need anything like that for this I need a strong well written guide with chapters structures reasoning insights this is for our inside team this is what this is used for and I need to save me a lot of time and I don't have time to teach each and then individual step so I need you to print me out a guide really quickly with links references as much as you can to how you validated this information

Perfect. I’ll build a comprehensive Funding Strategy and Playbook guide for your three blockchain projects: the Kenyan women's supply chain project, the Beacon crypto POS onboarding platform, and the Build-a-DAO AI-powered DAO launcher. I’ll prioritize both grants and VC funds, focus on deadlines between April and December 2025, and include global opportunities, with some prioritization for African region programs. I’ll also structure it clearly in sections with action steps, tables (Google Sheets ready), ranked opportunity lists, contact strategies, passive engagement methods, and references with validation links.

I’ll get started and let you know when it’s ready for your review.

Funding Strategy and Playbook for Blockchain Projects
This guide outlines a step-by-step approach to finding and securing funding (grants, hackathon prizes, accelerators, and VC) for three blockchain ventures: a Kenyan women’s supply-chain purchasing platform on Polkadot, Beacon (a Base/USDT/USDC POS solution for small merchants), and Build-a-DAO (an AI-driven no-code DAO platform). We surveyed the top ~20 blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana, Aptos, Sui, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Cosmos, NEAR, Tezos, Algorand, Celo, Hedera, Flow, XRP, Velas, etc.) for active grant and hackathon programs. Priority was given to programs with deadlines between April 28, 2025 and Dec 2025. We also noted new chains (launched 2023–24) and cross-chain initiatives that might fund strategic projects. The result is a funding-opportunity catalogue (table below) and a playbook covering discovery, prioritization, application best practices, and outreach tactics.
Researching Funding Opportunities
Scan official sources. Follow each ecosystem’s foundation blogs, “Grants” or “Support” pages, and social media (X/Twitter, Discord, Telegram) for announcements. For example, the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program recently ran a $2M Academic Grants Round
esp.ethereum.foundation
, and Avalanche’s Foundation launched a Community Grants program on Gitcoin
avax.network
. We compiled programs from Ethereum, Polkadot/Web3 Foundation, Avalanche, Solana, Aptos, Sui, Optimism, Base (Coinbase), Polygon, Cosmos, NEAR, BNB Chain, and others. Many ecosystems also sponsor hackathons (ETHGlobal events, Avalanche Summit, Solana Hackathons, etc.) with cash prizes or grants.
Note deadlines. We prioritized opportunities open in Apr–Dec 2025. For example, Avalanche Summit Hackathon (May 23–25, 2025) has a ~$50K prize pool
events.coinpedia.org
. Grant cycles vary: some are “rolling” (apply anytime) while others have fixed windows. We recorded each deadline and alert date in our table to plan applications accordingly.
Capture details. For each opportunity we logged: project/protocol name, program or hackathon name, website/link, application deadline, grant range (if public), contact person/role (if known), and recommended contact channel. Where specific POCs weren’t listed, we noted general channels (official email or Discord). We included new initiatives even without formal grants, e.g. emerging Layer‑1s likely to fund ecosystem partners.
Engage in ecosystem events. Many projects bootstrap via hackathons and community contests. For example, Avalanche Summit’s 2025 hackathon in London offers up to $50K in development prizes
events.coinpedia.org
, and similarly ETHGlobal events award significant grants. Participating and winning or even demoing at these events raises visibility with funders and mentors. Use conferences and hackathons to get feedback and contacts.
Catalog of Funding Opportunities
We assembled a master table of funding opportunities. Each entry lists the protocol/project, program name, links, deadlines, typical funding, and how to contact. (“Grant/Prize” is the award range or pool; “Channel” is how to apply or whom to reach out to.) This table can be exported to Google Sheets for tracking and sorting.

Notes on the table: We included official links where available. For ongoing programs (e.g. Web3 Foundation, Solana, Aptos) the “Deadline” is listed as “rolling” since proposals can be submitted any time. Contact names are where known (e.g. Avalanche CEO Aytunc Yildizli endorses community grants
avax.network
). In practice, outreach is usually via the foundation’s portal, Discord, or community forum.
Ranking and Prioritizing Opportunities
Deadline proximity: We first rank by impending deadlines. For example, if a grant deadline is June 2025 versus November 2025, we act on June first. For rolling programs, we include them but apply quickly.
Project fit: We assess alignment with each program’s focus. A social-impact supply-chain project (Kenya) strongly fits Polkadot/Web3F or Avalanche Public Goods; a POS/payment app (Beacon) matches DeFi payments grants (e.g. Coinbase, Chainlink); a DAO-building tool fits Ethereum/DAO ecosystem funding. We score each opportunity by fit (e.g. core blockchain innovation, public good, novel DeFi).
Award size: Large programs (e.g. Velas $100M fund
linkedin.com
) get high priority for possible scale-up, while small grants ($5k–$10k) are good for early-stage validation.
Effort vs. reward: Grants often require detailed proposals; hackathons need working demos. We balance low-effort “open calls” (quick form applications) versus high-effort pitches. Hackathons can be fast (weekend project) but also merit preparation.
Strategic value: Some programs are effectively marketing partnership opportunities. For instance, a joint program with Gitcoin
avax.network
 or accelerator connections may yield ongoing support beyond the award.
Applying for Grants and Competitions
Prepare materials: Craft a concise project blurb, one-pager or deck, and a demo/technical summary. All outreach should link to an up-to-date website or GitHub. Have one URL (e.g. project landing page) that aggregates team info, product video, and metrics.
Follow requirements: Carefully read each application’s criteria (eligibility, required forms). Many grants (e.g. Aptos
aptosfoundation.org
) have online forms with specific questions. Prepare a budget and roadmap section if requested. Hackathons often require a submission link or video.
Highlight impact: Quantify usage or communities served. For the Kenyan project, emphasize women empowerment, on-chain transparency, and alignment with sustainable development. Use local success stories. For Beacon, demonstrate user-friendly UX, security of Base/USDT rails, and merchant adoption plans. For Build-a-DAO, show a prototype and how AI simplifies token governance.
Cite references: If the program has “wishlist” topics (like Ethereum’s academic grants had categories
esp.ethereum.foundation
), tailor answers accordingly and cite any relevant sources (protocol docs, past projects) to show due diligence.
Proofread: Formal proposals must be clear, free of typos, and professional. Tailor language to the funder’s tone (e.g. technical for protocol grants, business-oriented for VC programs).
Outreach and Networking Workflow
We combine passive engagement with active contact:
Passive: Build presence first. Follow and engage on X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord in each ecosystem. Retweet or comment on relevant announcements (e.g. “Great to see [Protocol] funding eco-friendly supply-chain!”). Join community calls and Discord channels. This “warm up” helps you be recognized before you directly pitch. For example, joining the Avalanche Discord and upvoting the Community Grants channel lets you get friendly feedback
avax.network
.
Identify key people. Find relevant community managers or grant managers. On X or LinkedIn, follow names like Avalanche Foundation, Web3 Foundation, Aptos Grants Team. Sometimes high-profile figures (e.g. Dr. Gavin Wood for Polkadot, Do Kwon for Terra-era) are less accessible; focus on channel leads or grant admins instead.
Monitoring tools. Use RSS or Google Alerts on key terms (“Aptos grants”, “Avalanche hackathon 2025”) and subscribe to newsletters (e.g. Gitcoin). Track GitHub issues or forums (Web3 Foundation often posts on its forum).
Direct outreach (email/DM): When ready to apply or in follow-up:
Email: Find a general grants contact or strategy lead. An email template might start:
Subject: Grant Inquiry – [Project Name]
Hello [Name/Team],
I’m [Name], founder of [Project], which [brief one-line pitch, e.g. “enables Kenyan women’s co-ops to buy supplies on-chain via Polkadot”]. We have [milestones, e.g. “a working prototype and 20 local merchants onboarded”]. I’m very interested in your [Program Name] and would appreciate guidance on applying. Could we discuss fit and timeline?
Thank you for your work on [Protocol/Project]! I look forward to any advice.
Twitter/X DM: Craft a shorter pitch (since characters are limited). E.g.:
Hi [@Person], love your work on [Protocol]. I’m building [Project] (one-liner) and think it aligns with your grants program. Would love to connect about a potential application!
LinkedIn message: Use a connection request note: “Hi [Name], I’m an entrepreneur in the [Protocol] ecosystem. I admire [their work/role], and I’d value connecting to discuss how my [project] might fit your grants/hackathon.”
Follow-up sequence: If no reply in 1-2 weeks, send a polite nudge referencing your previous message and any updates (e.g. “Just finished our pilot test, would love to keep you posted”). Don’t spam; stop after 2 follow-ups unless engagement is evident.
Social proof: Share progress publicly. E.g. tweet “Thrilled to present [Beacon] at the #AvalancheSummit Hackathon next week!” to tag organizers, or post on LinkedIn when you apply to a grant. This shows seriousness and can attract inbound interest.
Networking at events: Attend meetups or hackathons for the chain. Introduce yourself to organizers and fellow teams. Sometimes event judges are also grant managers (especially at ETHGlobal). Building rapport in person (even virtual meetups) can open doors.
Outreach Materials
Prepare in advance for any outreach:
Elevator pitch: A 1-2 sentence summary of what your project does and why it matters. (E.g. “Beacon is a point-of-sale crypto payment solution using Base/USDT/USDC, making it easy for small merchants to accept digital dollars.”) Make this crystal clear.
One-pager/pitch deck: A 1–2 page PDF or short slide deck with problem, solution, market, team, roadmap, and ask (what you need from the funder). Include links to a demo or prototype video. Have both web and downloadable versions ready.
Project website or GitHub: A single URL (project site or GitHub repo) that a contact can visit for details. It should have your logo, tagline, team bios, and links to socials or whitepaper.
Socials and blogs: Maintain an active Twitter and a LinkedIn profile for your project. Regular updates (even short) show momentum. Write a Medium/Dev post or blog about your technology or pilot usage – having “thought leadership” content gives credibility.
Tech demo: For hackathons/accelerators, have a live demo or prototype video. For Beacon, maybe demo a payment flow; for Build-a-DAO, a screen-capture of DAO creation; for Polkadot supply-chain, a quick walkthrough of the on-chain purchasing process.
Metrics and traction: Even early-stage, collect any meaningful numbers: “10 pilot users, 50 USD volume, 3 merchant signups,” or “5,000 lines of code on GitHub,” or “teamed up with Kenyan women’s co-op association.” Funders value real-world evidence of progress or interest.
Funding Approach for Each Project
(1) Kenyan Women’s On-Chain Purchasing (Polkadot).  
This social-impact project best targets grants and hackathons. Polkadot’s Web3 Foundation and Treasury explicitly fund open-source and research that benefit Polkadot/Kusama
wiki.polkadot.network
. We recommend applying for Web3F grants (via grants.web3.foundation) and Polkadot treasury proposals (via the on-chain Treasury system
wiki.polkadot.network
). This approach fits the public-good nature of the project. Hackathons and competitions in Africa or women-in-tech (e.g. Gitcoin’s “City3 Africa” rounds or the Avalanche community grants for social projects
avax.network
) are high-impact too. Polkadot also runs local hackathons (e.g. ETHGlobal Nairobi, if any), so target those. VC funding is lower priority here, since the mission is public-good oriented; initial funding via grants will build credibility before seeking any private investment. (2) Beacon (POS Onboarding for Restaurants). 
This payments/fintech product can leverage accelerators, hackathons, and strategic grants. Given its commerce focus, seek accelerator programs (e.g. FinTech or startup accelerators; even Coinbase’s developer programs) and industry hackathons (e.g. Chainlink hackathons, Mastercard hackathons on crypto payments). The Base/USDT/USDC angle means Coinbase’s Base grants or hackathons could directly apply, and tapping stablecoin projects (Tether/USDC teams often sponsor events) could be fruitful. Additionally, blockchain ecosystem grants can seed early dev (e.g. Avalanche GovChain hackathons for retail tech, or Solana’s Web3 retail dApp fund). VC/angel funding is relevant once prototype exists—so plan later rounds from crypto/fintech VCs. In summary: hackathons/accelerators first (to build product and pilot), then targeted grants (to scale), then VC. Beacon is a classic fintech use-case: it benefits from proof-of-concept awards. Building a working POS demo (as shown above) will win developer grants like Base’s Builder Grants (1–5 ETH)
coinfabrik.com
 and venue-specific hackathon prizes. Such traction then attracts larger accelerators or investors. (3) Build-a-DAO (AI No-Code DAO Platform). 
DAOs are a hot focus in Web3. The best path is protocol grants and hackathons, especially on smart-contract platforms (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism). Start by applying to Ethereum ecosystem grants (ESP) or related funds (even Gitcoin grants). Participate in DAO hackathons (e.g. Aragon hackdays, DAOTrack by Polkadot, ETHGlobal DAO tracks). As a developer tool, it may qualify for multiple grant sources (Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, Gitcoin). Concurrently, join DAO/accelerator programs (there are blockchain incubators for developer tools). Later, once a userbase exists, fundraising from crypto-focused VCs makes sense, but only after demonstrating adoption.

Key Takeaways and Next Steps
Be thorough and persistent. Track each opportunity’s timeline in your sheet, set reminders, and tailor every application.
Engage the community early. Use social proof and soft engagement well before formal asks.
Follow up politely. If you apply and hear nothing, send an update or thank-you note; responsiveness can open doors.
Iterate on feedback. If a grant feedback is soft or competition harsh, refine the pitch or try the next deadline.
By combining this opportunity database with structured outreach, your team will systematically cover the ecosystem. Focus first on grants/hackathons that are closest and best-fit, while building the project narrative and collateral needed for larger funding.
