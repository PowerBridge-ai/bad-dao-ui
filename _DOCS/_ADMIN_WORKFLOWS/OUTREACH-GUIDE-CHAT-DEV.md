OK I need your assistance in making a outreach playbook for our founder and communications director of our decentralized autonomous organization I gave you the link above go to the link get some background information do the research come back to me what we need to do is establish a outreach playbook for the founder to be able to reach out to different projects basically different levels of communication patterns so that would mean structuring all of his interactions with the outside world if they're not internal team members then they have a screw and they have a format which we should be able to expand upon the way that we're working so what I want fundamentally is for you to go in structure the levels of communication so if it's like with the public or with the community right social media that kind of thing but if it's for like business communications that's mainly what this guide is for we want a play by play of how to introduce the company our team our project scripts that a list of scripts you don't have to make the actual scripts but a list of scripts numbered step by step or put into a hierarchy in which it makes sense for us to continue to process a business relationship so that means it's like from the introduction to converting them into a lead and then from a lead to a client and then that client business relationship or client contract relationship whichever one we have even business to partner relationship whatever those business relationships structured are he doesn't have a strategy for this and he's been going at it blind he's really good at talking and really good at explaining things if he has enough information but as of right now he has no strategy so we need to give him a strategy and structured templates to go off of so he can develop the relationships and grow on the web 3 space and ecosystem so what that means is like for the safari and all the other parts of the ecosystem that we've been a part of over the last few years he can engage on a different level now now that he has a sustainable project the sustainable revenue model MVP and something to talk about so that includes like doing the daily articles having the the AI agents create the articles and and push those out into the public creating scheduled iterations of communication patterns for the public as well as privately internally to keep everybody updated from like a perspective of investors or partners who may need to have like a newsletter so all of the communication patterns to get him to success
