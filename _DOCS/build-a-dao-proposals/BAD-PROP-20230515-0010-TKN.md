## 📊 Metadata
- **Title:** BAD Token Distribution and Allocation Framework
- **Author:** BAD DAO Core Team
- **Date:** 2023-05-15
- **Category:** Tokenomics
- **Status:** 🟡 Draft
- **Required Approvals:** 5/6 Core Team Members
- **Implementation Timeframe:** 48h

## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the comprehensive framework for BAD token distribution and allocation across stakeholder groups, including core team, early contributors, community, treasury, and ecosystem development. The token allocation model is designed to ensure fair distribution, align incentives among participants, support sustainable growth, and provide sufficient resources for ongoing development. This framework will guide all token distribution activities and serve as the foundation for the tokenomics of the BAD DAO ecosystem.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective
To establish a balanced and strategic token allocation framework that ensures equitable distribution among stakeholders, incentivizes long-term participation, and provides sustainable funding for DAO operations and growth.

### 📝 Description
The BAD token serves as the governance and utility token for the BAD DAO ecosystem. This proposal defines the initial allocation of the total token supply among various stakeholder groups, establishes vesting schedules to ensure long-term alignment, and outlines distribution mechanisms for each category.

The allocation model balances the need to reward early contributors and core team members with the importance of building a broad community of token holders. It reserves significant portions for treasury operations and ecosystem development to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.
