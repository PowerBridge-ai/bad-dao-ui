## 🔍 Overview

The Voting Recommendation Agent is a specialized AI system that generates data-driven governance recommendations to support informed decision-making within the BAD DAO. Working in concert with the Proposal Analyzer Agent, it transforms analytical data into actionable voting guidance while maintaining transparency about its reasoning process.
