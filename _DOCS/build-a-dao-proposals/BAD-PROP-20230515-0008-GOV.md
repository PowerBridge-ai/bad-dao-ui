## 📊 Metadata
- **Title:** BAD DAO Snapshot Governance Implementation
- **Author:** BAD DAO Core Team
- **Date:** 2023-05-15
- **Category:** Governance
- **Status:** 🟡 Draft
- **Required Approvals:** 4/6 Core Team Members
- **Implementation Timeframe:** 24h

## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the immediate implementation of Snapshot.org as the primary off-chain governance platform for BAD DAO. The integration will enable rapid deployment of proposal creation, voting, and delegation mechanisms while on-chain governance contracts are being developed and audited. This approach allows the DAO to begin formal decision-making processes immediately while maintaining security and minimizing gas costs.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective
To implement a fully functional governance system within 24 hours using Snapshot.org that enables immediate proposal creation, voting, and decision execution by BAD token holders.

### 📝 Description
BAD DAO requires an immediate governance solution to facilitate formal decision-making. By leveraging Snapshot.org, we can rapidly deploy governance functionality that integrates with our existing BAD token deployed on Thirdweb. This implementation provides a secure, gas-free voting mechanism while maintaining cryptographic verification of votes and supporting multiple voting strategies.

The Snapshot implementation will serve as the primary governance mechanism during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our implementation timeline, with a planned transition to on-chain governance in Phase 3 once smart contracts are fully audited and deployed.

### 📊 Specifications

```yaml
platform: "Snapshot.org"
space_name: "BAD DAO"
governance_token: "BAD (Thirdweb deployed ERC-20)"
voting_strategies:
  - name: "erc20-balance-of"
    params:
      symbol: "BAD"
      address: "0x..." # Insert actual token address
      decimals: 18
  - name: "delegation"
    params:
      symbol: "BAD"
      address: "0x..." # Insert actual token address
      decimals: 18
proposal_validation:
  min_voting_power: 100000 # 100,000 BAD tokens required to create proposals
voting_system: "single-choice" # Default, with options for approval and quadratic
voting_period: 72 # Hours
quorum: 2 # Percent of total supply required for valid vote
privacy: "public" # All votes are public
```

### 💰 Financial Impact

```yaml
cost: "0 ETH for voting (gas-free)"
setup_cost: "~0.05 ETH for ENS and initial setup"
ongoing_costs: "None (Snapshot.org is free to use)"
timeframe: "Indefinite use, with planned transition to on-chain governance in Q3 2023"
```

## 🔄 Implementation

### 📝 Implementation Steps
1. Create and configure BAD DAO space on Snapshot.org
2. Set up ENS domain for the Snapshot space
3. Configure voting strategies, parameters, and permissions
4. Create proposal templates for different governance actions
5. Link Snapshot space to official communication channels
6. Develop and publish governance participation guide
7. Conduct test votes to verify functionality
8. Announce governance launch to community
9. Host educational session on governance participation
