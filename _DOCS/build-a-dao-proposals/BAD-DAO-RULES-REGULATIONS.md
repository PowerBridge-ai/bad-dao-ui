## üîç Overview

This document establishes the fundamental rules and regulations that govern the BAD DAO. It serves as the constitutional framework that guides all operations, decision-making, and treasury management within the organization. All proposals, actions, and initiatives undertaken by the DAO must align with and adhere to these foundational rules and regulations.

The Rules and Regulations Framework is designed to:
1. Embody the core mission and objectives of BAD DAO
2. Establish clear operational parameters for governance
3. Define treasury management principles and constraints
4. Create systematic processes for proposal, voting, and implementation
5. Enable autonomous operations with appropriate checks and balances
6. Support scalable, sustainable growth of the treasury and ecosystem

## üèõÔ∏è Core Principles

The following core principles form the foundation upon which all rules and regulations are built:

### üéØ Mission Alignment
All activities, decisions, and resource allocations must align with and advance the core mission of BAD DAO to build and promote decentralized autonomous organizations as engines of innovation and collective value creation.

### üîç Transparency
All governance processes, treasury operations, and decision-making must remain transparent and accessible to all members, fostering trust and enabling informed participation.

### üîê Security
The protection of treasury assets, member data, and operational integrity is paramount, requiring robust security measures at all levels of the organization.

### üó≥Ô∏è Democratic Governance
Decision-making authority ultimately rests with the collective membership through transparent, fair, and accessible voting mechanisms that reflect token-weighted preferences.

### üå± Sustainable Growth
All initiatives should contribute to the sustainable growth of the treasury, community, and ecosystem, with a focus on long-term value creation over short-term gains.

### ü§ñ Autonomous Operation
Systems and processes should support maximum operational autonomy while maintaining appropriate human oversight and intervention capabilities.

## üìú Rules

Rules represent the immutable core governance directives that define what the DAO can and cannot do. They require a higher threshold to modify (75% approval) and form the constitutional foundation of the organization.

**Title:** Primary Mission Directive  
**Description:** All activities of BAD DAO must explicitly advance the core mission of building, promoting, and improving decentralized autonomous organizations as vehicles for collective coordination, value creation, and equitable distribution of resources. No proposal, initiative, or expenditure that contradicts this mission may be approved, regardless of other potential benefits.  
**Enforcement:** Any proposal that fails to demonstrate clear alignment with the core mission shall be automatically rejected.  
**Amendment Threshold:** 85% approval from voting token holders.

### RULE-0002: Treasury Sovereignty
**Title:** Treasury Asset Protection

**Amendment Threshold:** 85% approval from voting token holders.

### RULE-0003: Governance Authority

**Amendment Threshold:** 80% approval from voting token holders.

### RULE-0008: Security First
