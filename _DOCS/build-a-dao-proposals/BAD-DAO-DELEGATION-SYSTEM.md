## 🔍 Overview

The BAD DAO Delegation System enables token holders to transfer their voting power to specialized delegates without transferring token ownership. This creates an efficient division of labor where token holders can maintain their governance rights while delegating active participation to experts who specialize in governance activities. The system is designed to increase overall governance participation while maintaining high-quality decision-making.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The delegation system is built on three core components:

### 1. 📜 Delegation Registry

```mermaid

    A --> C[Lock Management]
    A --> D[History Tracking]

    style B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3,D1,D2,D3 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

- **Delegation Mapping**: Core data structure tracking delegated voting power
- **Lock Management**: Controls time-locking of delegated tokens
- **History Tracking**: Records delegation events and voting patterns

### 2. 🌟 Reputation System

    end
```

### 1. Delegation Initiation

1. **Selection Process**:
   - Token holder reviews available delegates and their profiles
   - Evaluates reputation scores, voting history, and stated principles
   - Optionally communicates with potential delegates
   - Selects delegate(s) aligned with their governance priorities

2. **Delegation Action**:
   - Token holder specifies amount of voting power to delegate
   - Sets delegation period (minimum 7 days)
   - Confirms delegation transaction on-chain
   - Receives confirmation and delegation receipt

3. **Activation Timeline**:
   - Delegation takes effect immediately
   - Delegate voting power increases proportionally
   - Lock period begins counting down
   - First rewards calculation at next epoch (daily)

### 2. Active Delegation Period

1. **Delegate Responsibilities**:
   - Regular participation in governance votes
   - Publishing vote explanations and rationales
   - Communication with delegators on significant proposals
   - Maintaining stated principles and voting framework

2. **Delegator Options**:
   - Monitor delegate voting activity
   - Review performance metrics
   - Receive regular updates from delegate
   - Extend delegation period if desired

3. **Governance Participation**:
   - Delegates cast votes with accumulated voting power
   - Voting activity recorded for reputation calculation
   - Vote alignment tracked for performance metrics
   - Rewards accumulated based on participation

### 3. Delegation Termination

1. **Standard Termination**:
   - Delegation automatically ends after lock period
   - Voting power returns to token holder
   - Final rewards calculated and distributed
   - Relationship metrics recorded

2. **Early Revocation Request**:
   - Token holder requests early termination
   - Must wait for minimum lock period to complete
   - May incur reduced rewards
   - Reputation impact for delegate limited

3. **Post-Delegation**:
   - Token holder receives voting power back
   - Can immediately re-delegate to same or different delegate
   - Delegation history maintained for future reference
   - Feedback opportunity provided

## 🎁 Incentive Structure

The delegation system incorporates financial incentives to encourage participation and align interests between delegates and delegators.

### Key Contract Functions

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
interface IBADDelegation {
    // Core delegation functions
    function delegate(address delegatee, uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external;
    function revokeDelegation(address delegatee, uint256 amount) external;
    function extendLock(address delegatee, uint256 newDuration) external;
    
    // Reward functions
    function claimDelegatorRewards() external;
    function claimDelegateRewards() external;
    
    // View functions
    function getDelegatedPower(address delegatee) external view returns (uint256);
    function getUserDelegations(address delegator) external view returns (DelegationInfo[] memory);
    function getDelegatePerformance(address delegatee) external view returns (PerformanceMetrics memory);
    
    // Structs
    struct DelegationInfo {
        address delegatee;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 lockEndTime;
        uint256 startTime;
    }
    
    struct PerformanceMetrics {
        uint256 participationRate;
        uint256 alignmentScore;
        uint256 reputationScore;
        uint256 delegatedTotal;
    }
}
```

### Integration Points

The delegation system integrates with other protocol components:

1. **Governor Contract**: 
   - Tracks voting power including delegations
   - Records voting activity for performance metrics
   - Provides proposal data for reward calculations

2. **Token Contract**: 
   - Queries token balances
   - Verifies delegation eligibility
   - Calculates time-weighted voting power

3. **Treasury Contract**: 
   - Sources reward funding
   - Manages delegation incentive pool
   - Distributes rewards to participants

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

As the delegation system grows, several scalability enhancements are planned:
