## üìä Metadata
- **Title:** Build a DAO Governance Framework Implementation
- **Author:** BAD DAO Core Team
- **Date:** 2023-05-01
- **Category:** Governance
- **Status:** üü° Draft
- **Required Approvals:** 5/6 Core Team Members (including AI)
- **Implementation Timeframe:** 7d

## üîç Executive Summary

This proposal seeks to formalize and implement the BAD DAO Governance Framework as a comprehensive system for decision-making, proposal management, and organizational governance. The framework establishes clear roles, responsibilities, voting mechanisms, and proposal processes to ensure efficient, transparent, and secure governance of the DAO. It incorporates AI-assisted governance, implements multi-sig security controls, and creates standardized proposal workflows that will form the foundation of all DAO operations.

## üìã Proposal Details

### üéØ Objective

To establish and implement a comprehensive governance framework for BAD DAO that enables efficient decision-making, ensures appropriate security controls, clearly defines roles and responsibilities, and leverages AI for governance optimization.

### üìù Description

The BAD DAO Governance Framework provides the foundational structure for all organizational decision-making and operational management. This proposal seeks to formalize the implementation of this framework as outlined in the BAD DAO Governance Framework Proposal document.

Key components of the governance framework include:

1. **Role Definitions**: Clear delineation of core team roles, contributors, delegates, and community members with associated responsibilities and rights.

2. **AI Governance Agents**: Integration of specialized AI agents for proposal analysis, voting recommendations, treasury oversight, and task management.

3. **Proposal Process**: Standardized workflow for proposal submission, discussion, voting, and implementation with appropriate timeframes and thresholds.

4. **Multi-Signature Security**: Implementation of role-based multi-sig requirements for various proposal types to ensure security and prevent unilateral action.

5. **Voting Mechanisms**: Establishment of voting power calculation, delegation system, and voting thresholds for different proposal categories.

6. **Emergency Response System**: Clear protocols for addressing critical security incidents or urgent operational needs.

This governance framework will be implemented through smart contracts where appropriate and through documented processes where on-chain governance is not yet implemented. The framework is designed to evolve over time, with initial phases focused on core team governance and later phases expanding to broader community participation.

## üîÑ Implementation

### üìù Implementation Steps

1. Finalize and approve governance framework documentation
2. Deploy initial governance smart contracts to testnet
3. Configure multisig wallets according to role specifications
4. Test proposal submission and voting mechanisms
5. Create comprehensive documentation for all governance processes
6. Train core team on governance procedures
7. Deploy governance contracts to mainnet
8. Implement proposal tracking and management system
9. Configure AI governance agents for production
10. Submit test proposals through new governance system
