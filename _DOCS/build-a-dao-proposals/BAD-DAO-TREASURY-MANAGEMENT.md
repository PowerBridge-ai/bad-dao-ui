### ⏱️ Time-lock Mechanics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Initiator
    participant Treasury Contract
    participant Multi-sig Wallet
    participant Time-lock Contract
    participant Execution
    
    Initiator->>Treasury Contract: Request Transaction
    Treasury Contract->>Multi-sig Wallet: Submit for Approval
    
    loop Approval Process
        Multi-sig Wallet->>Multi-sig Wallet: Collect Required Signatures
    end
    
    Multi-sig Wallet->>Time-lock Contract: Queue Transaction
    Time-lock Contract->>Time-lock Contract: Enforce Delay Period
    
    Note over Time-lock Contract: Display Transaction Details Publicly
    
    alt Cancellation
        Initiator->>Time-lock Contract: Cancel Transaction
        Time-lock Contract->>Multi-sig Wallet: Reset Approval Process
    else Execution
        Time-lock Contract->>Execution: Execute After Delay Period
        Execution->>Treasury Contract: Update Treasury State
    end
```
