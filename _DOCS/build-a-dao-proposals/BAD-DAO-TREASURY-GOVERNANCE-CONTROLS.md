### 🔒 Key Management Protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant KG as Key Generation
    participant SP as Secure Storage
    participant KR as Key Rotation
    participant RP as Recovery Protocol
    
    Note over KG: Secure Generation Ceremony

## ⏱️ Time-lock Mechanisms

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Proposal
    participant M as Multi-sig
    participant T as Time-lock
    participant E as Execution
    
    P->>M: Submit Transaction
    M->>M: Collect Signatures
    M->>T: Queue Transaction
    
    Note over T: Delay Period Begins
    
    alt Cancellation
        P->>T: Cancel Transaction
        T->>T: Remove from Queue
    else Execution
        T->>E: Execute after Delay
    end
```

Time-lock mechanisms provide additional security by enforcing delay periods between transaction approval and execution:

### 📅 Graduated Time-locks

The treasury implements a graduated time-lock system based on transaction significance:

| Treasury Type | Transaction Size | Time-lock Period | Cancellation Authority |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Operational | <0.5% | None | N/A |
| Operational | 0.5-1% | 24 hours | 3/5 Multi-sig |
| Growth | <1% | 48 hours | 4/7 Multi-sig |
| Growth | 1-3% | 72 hours | 5/7 Multi-sig or Governance |
| Growth | >3% | 7 days | 5/7 Multi-sig or Governance |
| Reserve | Any | 7 days | 6/9 Multi-sig or Governance |
| Parameter Change | Any | 14 days | Governance Vote |

### 🚫 Cancellation Mechanisms

Transactions in the time-lock queue can be cancelled through:

1. **Multi-signature Cancellation**
   - Requires same or higher signature threshold as approval
   - Available throughout the time-lock period
   - Requires documented justification
   - Generates governance notification

2. **Governance Cancellation**
   - Emergency governance proposal
   - Expedited voting process (48 hours)
   - 15% quorum requirement
   - 60% approval threshold

3. **Guardian Intervention**
   - Available for security incidents only
   - Requires 6/9 Guardian multi-sig
   - Generates immediate governance notification
   - Requires post-action justification

### 🔄 Time-lock Implementation

The time-lock contract includes:

1. **Queue Management**
   - FIFO transaction execution
   - Transaction dependency tracking
   - Collision detection and resolution
   - Maximum queue capacity with overflow protection

2. **Execution Timing**
   - Exact unlock timestamp calculation
   - Gas optimization for execution timing
   - Execution attempt retry mechanism
   - Maximum execution time window

3. **Security Features**
