## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the delegation system for BAD DAO governance, enabling token holders to delegate their voting power to specialized delegates without transferring token ownership. The delegation framework includes time-locking mechanisms, performance-based incentives, delegation caps, and a reputation system to ensure high-quality governance participation. By implementing this system, the DAO can achieve efficient governance with expert delegates while maintaining broad community participation and alignment.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To implement a comprehensive delegation system that enables efficient, expert-driven governance while maintaining broad community participation, aligning incentives between delegators and delegates, and ensuring high-quality decision-making.

### 📝 Description

The BAD DAO delegation system creates a mechanism for token holders to transfer their voting power to specialized delegates without relinquishing ownership of their tokens. This allows for a division of labor in governance, where those with expertise in specific areas can focus on governance activities, while other token holders can maintain their governance rights through careful delegate selection.

The delegation system includes several key features:

1. **Time-locked Delegation**: Delegations are locked for a minimum of 7 days to prevent strategic manipulation of voting power.

2. **Performance-based Incentives**: Both delegates and delegators receive rewards based on participation, alignment, and longevity of delegation.

3. **Delegation Caps**: Maximum delegation limits (5% of total supply per delegate) to prevent excessive concentration of voting power.

4. **Delegate Reputation System**: Delegates build reputation based on participation, voting alignment, and community feedback.

5. **Delegation Splitting**: Token holders can split their delegation among multiple specialized delegates.

The delegation contract will interact with the governance system to calculate voting power, track delegate performance, and distribute incentives. Delegation rewards will come from a dedicated portion of the DAO treasury specifically allocated for governance participation incentives.
