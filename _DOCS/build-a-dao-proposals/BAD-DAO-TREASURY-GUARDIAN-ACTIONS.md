## üîç Overview

This document defines the standardized action framework for the Treasury Guardian AI, specifying the precise actions, commands, and protocols it can execute to fulfill its security mandate. These actions are designed with appropriate boundaries to ensure the Guardian can effectively protect treasury assets while maintaining necessary human oversight.

## üìù Action Schema

Each Treasury Guardian action follows a standardized schema:

    type: Data type
    required: True/False
    description: Parameter purpose
    validation: Validation rules
execution_context: Where and when this action can be executed
side_effects: Potential consequences of this action
