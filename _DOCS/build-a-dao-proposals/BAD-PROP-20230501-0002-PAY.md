## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes a standardized compensation structure for all BAD DAO core team members, creating consistency and predictability in the organization's financial obligations. The structure includes a base monthly compensation rate with defined negotiation periods, allowing for both stability and flexibility as the organization evolves. This compensation model is designed to attract and retain top talent while providing appropriate financial governance controls.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To establish a fair, transparent, and sustainable compensation framework for BAD DAO core team members that aligns with both market standards and the organization's current financial capabilities.

### 📝 Description

The BAD DAO requires a standardized approach to core team compensation to ensure equitable treatment of team members and create predictable financial planning for the organization. This proposal outlines a compensation structure that provides financial stability for core team members while incorporating flexibility through regular negotiation periods.

The base compensation rate is set at $5,000 USD per month per core team member. This rate represents a competitive entry point for the caliber of talent required for the organization's success while remaining fiscally responsible given our current funding status.

A key feature of this compensation structure is the inclusion of regular negotiation periods. During the first six months, core team members will have the opportunity to renegotiate terms every 30 days, allowing for rapid adjustments as the organization develops and individual contributions are assessed. After the initial six-month period, negotiation opportunities will shift to a quarterly (90-day) cadence, providing longer-term stability while still offering regular reassessment.

Future proposals will address retroactive compensation for work already completed by core team members.
