## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the initial treasury management structure for BAD DAO, including multi-signature wallet configuration, spending approval thresholds, role assignments, and reporting requirements.

This foundation will be critical for managing project funds, demonstrating fiscal responsibility to stakeholders, and supporting the growth of the ecosystem.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective
To implement a secure, transparent, and efficient treasury management system that safeguards DAO assets while enabling effective resource allocation for project development and community growth.

### 📝 Description
The BAD DAO treasury requires formalized management procedures to ensure proper stewardship of community assets. This proposal establishes a multi-tiered approval system based on transaction value, implements role-based access controls, defines spending categories and limits, establishes reporting requirements, and sets treasury diversification guidelines.

The treasury management structure is designed to balance security with operational efficiency, implementing stronger controls for larger transactions while allowing streamlined processes for day-to-day operations. Regular reporting ensures transparency, and the structure includes checks and balances to prevent misappropriation of funds.
