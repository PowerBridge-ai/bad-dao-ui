## üìã Proposal Details

### üéØ Objective
To formalize a strategic partnership between Build A DAO AI and Gain Chain AI that provides BADA with advanced blockchain development capabilities while establishing a mutually beneficial revenue-sharing arrangement for both organizations.

### üìù Description
Over the past three months, Miss Lulu, founder of Gain Chain AI and head of coding, development, research, and education for Build A DAO AI, has developed a comprehensive partnership framework between the two organizations. This partnership will give BADA access to Gain Chain AI's cutting-edge SDK, UI packages, and code building infrastructure specifically designed for AI blockchain automation.

This strategic alliance will enable BADA to rapidly accelerate its blockchain development capabilities, implementing advanced smart contract systems, decentralized applications, and AI-blockchain integration tools with significantly reduced development time and technical complexity. The partnership leverages the unique position of Miss Lulu across both organizations to ensure seamless collaboration and aligned objectives.

Gain Chain AI will serve as BADA's primary blockchain development partner for a period of five years, with provisions for term renegotiation through proper amendment mediation if required by both parties. In exchange for their technology and services, Gain Chain AI will receive 25% of funds generated from smart contract fees associated with systems developed using their technology.
