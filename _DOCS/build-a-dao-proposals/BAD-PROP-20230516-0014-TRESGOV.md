## üìä Metadata
- **Title:** Enhanced Treasury Governance Security Framework
- **Author:** BAD DAO Core Team
- **Date:** 2025-05-02
- **Category:** Treasury
- **Status:** üü¢ Approved
- **Required Approvals:** 5/6 Core Team Members
- **Implementation Timeframe:** 96h

## üîç Executive Summary

This proposal establishes an enhanced security framework for BAD DAO treasury governance, implementing additional safeguards to protect treasury assets and prevent unauthorized access. It creates a comprehensive system that combines multisignature requirements, timelocks, AI-powered monitoring, and mandatory voting procedures for fund movements. The framework ensures that no funds can be withdrawn without proper authorization, governance approval for significant amounts, and transparent documentation of all transactions.

## üìã Proposal Details

### üéØ Objective
To implement a comprehensive treasury security framework that ensures all fund movements require appropriate authorization, provides real-time monitoring and alerting, and eliminates single points of failure or potential for unauthorized access.

### üìù Description
While our existing treasury management structure (BAD-PROP-20250501-0009-TREAS) establishes the foundation for treasury operations, this proposal enhances the security and governance controls specifically focused on preventing unauthorized withdrawals and ensuring mandatory verification protocols. It implements a multi-layer security approach combining hardware security, smart contract controls, AI monitoring, and human oversight.

The enhanced framework integrates with the AI Governance Agents (BAD-PROP-20250501-0012-AI) by implementing an autonomous Treasury Guardian AI that continuously monitors transactions, analyzes patterns, and triggers alerts for suspicious activities. This Treasury Guardian operates independently from the advisory Treasury Oversight Agent, with a specific security-focused mandate.
