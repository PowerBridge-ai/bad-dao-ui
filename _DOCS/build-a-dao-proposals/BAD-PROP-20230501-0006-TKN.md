## 📊 Metadata
- **Title:** BAD DAO Tokenomics Model Implementation
- **Author:** BAD DAO Core Team
- **Date:** 2023-05-01
- **Category:** Tokenomics
- **Status:** 🟡 Draft
- **Required Approvals:** 5/6 Core Team Members (including AI)
- **Implementation Timeframe:** 7d

## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the comprehensive tokenomics model for the BAD DAO, including the initial supply, distribution mechanisms, token utility, and economic incentives. The tokenomics framework is designed to create long-term sustainable value, align incentives across different stakeholder groups, and provide robust governance mechanisms. By implementing this model, the DAO will establish a solid economic foundation for growth, user adoption, and effective protocol governance.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To implement a tokenomics model that creates sustainable value, aligns stakeholder incentives, enables effective governance, and provides a solid foundation for the growth and adoption of the Build a DAO platform.

### 📝 Description

The BAD DAO tokenomics model establishes the BAD token as the primary governance instrument and utility token within the ecosystem. The model includes a fixed maximum supply, a carefully designed distribution strategy, clearly defined token utility, and incentive mechanisms designed to reward different forms of participation in the protocol.

The BAD token will serve multiple purposes within the ecosystem:

1. **Governance**: Token holders can vote on proposals or delegate voting power to specialized delegates, with voting power weighted by token holdings and holding duration.

2. **Platform Fee Discounts**: Users of the Build a DAO platform can stake BAD tokens to receive discounts on platform fees, encouraging token holding and ecosystem participation.

3. **Participation Rewards**: Active participants in governance, platform development, and community building can earn BAD tokens through various incentive programs.

4. **Access to Premium Features**: Certain advanced features of the platform may require BAD token holding or staking.

The token supply distribution is carefully designed to ensure sufficient allocation to core team members and contributors (with appropriate vesting), while maintaining adequate treasury reserves and enabling community participation through fair distribution mechanisms.

### 💰 Financial Impact

```yaml
cost: "Smart contract development and audit costs"

timeframe: "Full implementation within 30 days"
affected_accounts: "All token holders and platform users"
```

## 🔄 Implementation

### 📝 Implementation Steps

1. Finalize tokenomics model and parameters
2. Complete token contract development and security audit
3. Deploy token contract to mainnet
4. Configure vesting contracts for team and contributor allocations
5. Deploy staking contract for fee discounts and rewards
6. Implement governance voting weight calculation
7. Develop token utility features in platform interface
8. Create tokenomics documentation and educational materials
9. Configure fee collection and distribution system
10. Launch initial community distribution mechanisms
