## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the token vesting structure for the BAD DAO, including allocation percentages, vesting schedules, and distribution mechanisms. The vesting framework is designed to align long-term incentives across core team members, contributors, early adopters, and the community while ensuring sufficient treasury reserves for ongoing development. The proposal includes the deployment of a dedicated vesting smart contract with cliff periods, linear vesting schedules, and appropriate security controls.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To implement a comprehensive token vesting structure that aligns incentives among stakeholders, ensures long-term commitment from the core team, provides appropriate rewards for contributors, and maintains adequate treasury reserves for protocol growth.

### 📝 Description

The BAD DAO token vesting structure allocates the total supply of 100 million BAD tokens across several key stakeholder groups, with specific vesting schedules designed to align incentives and ensure long-term commitment. By implementing appropriate cliff periods and linear vesting schedules, the framework protects against early token dumps while providing regular liquidity to engaged participants.

The vesting structure creates a sustainable foundation for the DAO's operations by allocating a significant portion to the treasury, which will fund ongoing development, operational expenses, and future initiatives. Core team allocations include substantial cliff periods to ensure long-term alignment with the project's success.

The vesting contract will be deployed as a standalone smart contract with secure withdrawal mechanics, role-based access controls, and appropriate time locks. The contract will interact with the governance system to enable adjustments to vesting schedules when approved through proper governance channels.
