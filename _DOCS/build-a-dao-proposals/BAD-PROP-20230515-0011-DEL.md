## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal establishes the BAD DAO delegation system, enabling token holders to delegate their voting power to trusted community members. The delegation system is designed to increase governance participation, allow for specialized representation, and ensure that governance decisions reflect the broader community's interests even when individual token holders cannot actively participate in every vote. The proposal outlines delegation mechanics, delegate qualifications, reputation systems, and incentive structures.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective
To implement a comprehensive delegation system that increases governance participation rates, provides specialized representation, and ensures governance decisions reflect the broader community's interests.

### 📝 Description
The BAD DAO governance system will benefit from a robust delegation mechanism that allows token holders to delegate their voting power to trusted community members. This delegation system enhances governance participation by enabling passive token holders to have their interests represented, reduces the barrier to governance participation, and helps maintain quorum requirements for proposals.

The system includes delegate registration and verification processes, a reputation system to track delegate performance, incentive mechanisms to reward effective delegates, and transparency tools to monitor delegation activity. The delegation framework will initially be implemented through Snapshot.org for off-chain voting, with a planned transition to on-chain delegation as smart contracts are deployed.
