```

The treasury implements automated functions to reduce governance overhead:

1. **💸 Recurring Payments**: Automatic execution of approved recurring payments for:
   - Core team compensation
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Contributor rewards
   - Ecosystem grants

2. **📈 Revenue Distribution**: Automatic allocation of incoming revenue:
   - 50% to operational treasury
   - 30% to development fund
   - 15% to community rewards
   - 5% to emergency reserves

3. **⚖️ Treasury Rebalancing**: Automated maintenance of target allocation ratios between:
   - Stable assets (USDC, DAI) - 40%
   - Protocol native tokens - 30%
   - Blue-chip crypto assets (ETH, BTC) - 20%
   - High-potential investments - 10%

```

The economic structure aligns incentives across different stakeholders, ensuring sustainable growth and fair value distribution. Protocol fees and rewards are distributed to various participants based on their contributions and stake in the system.

1. **📈 Staking Incentives**:
   - Rewards increase with staking duration
   - Compounding rewards for continuous staking
   - Enhanced governance power for long-term stakers

2. **💰 Protocol Fee Distribution**:
   - 0.1% fee on protocol transactions
   - Revenue allocation:
     - 40% to treasury for ongoing operations
     - 30% to stakers as passive income
     - 20% to active contributors
     - 10% to active delegates

3. **⚙️ Validator Economics**:
   - Performance-based rewards for network validators
   - Slashing penalties for malicious or negligent behavior
   - Incentive structure promoting network health

## 📈 Governance Impact

Token allocation directly impacts governance outcomes through voting power distribution:

### ⏱️ Time-Weighted Voting

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Token Holding Period] --> B[30+ Days]
    A --> C[90+ Days]
    A --> D[180+ Days]
    
    B --> B1[1.2x Multiplier]
    C --> C1[1.5x Multiplier]
    D --> D1[2.0x Multiplier]
    
    B1 --> E[Voting Power Calculation]
    C1 --> E
    D1 --> E
    
    E --> F[Final Voting Weight]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B,C,D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B1,C1,D1 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E,F fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Time-weighted voting incentivizes long-term commitment to the protocol by increasing voting power based on token holding duration:

- Tokens held for 30+ days: 1.2x voting power
- Tokens held for 90+ days: 1.5x voting power
- Tokens held for 180+ days: 2.0x voting power

This mechanism reduces the influence of short-term token holders and rewards long-term stakeholders who are more likely to vote in the best interest of the protocol's future.

### 📊 Role-Based Multipliers

| 👥 Role | 📊 Voting Multiplier | 🧮 Calculation Example |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Core Team | 1.5x | 10,000 tokens × 1.5 = 15,000 votes |
| Contributors | 1.0x | 10,000 tokens × 1.0 = 10,000 votes |
| Delegates | Reputation-based | 10,000 tokens × (1.0-1.3) = 10,000-13,000 votes |
| Community | 1.0x | 10,000 tokens × 1.0 = 10,000 votes |
