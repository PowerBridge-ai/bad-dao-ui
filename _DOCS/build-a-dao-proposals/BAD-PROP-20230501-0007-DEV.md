## 🔍 Executive Summary

This proposal provides a comprehensive review of the 14-day bootstrap plan implementation progress, identifying completed tasks, current blockers, and unfinished work. The review highlights significant achievements in smart contract deployment and verification while acknowledging challenges with multisig wallet integration. Based on this evaluation, the proposal outlines an adjusted timeline and resource allocation strategy to complete the remaining critical tasks, with a specific focus on unblocking the voting and proposal mechanisms which are essential for securing funding and maintaining development momentum.

## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To evaluate the current progress of the 14-day bootstrap plan, identify critical blockers, and establish a revised plan to accelerate completion of essential components required for securing funding and operational functionality.

### 📝 Description

The BAD DAO's 14-day bootstrap plan was established to rapidly develop and deploy the essential governance infrastructure necessary for securing funding and establishing operational capacity. This review analyzes progress against the original plan, evaluates the effectiveness of the current development approach, and proposes adjustments to ensure swift completion of remaining critical components.

#### Progress Assessment

The team has successfully accomplished several key milestones:
- Deployment of the BAD governance token smart contract
- Verification of the contract on BaseScan
- Initial token minting and distribution
- Documentation of governance framework
- Development of proposal templates and formats

However, several blockers have emerged that have impeded completion of the full bootstrap plan:
- Integration challenges with Safe wallet and multisig mechanisms
- Delays in the implementation of the voting and proposal mechanisms
- Incomplete smart contract integrations for governance actions
- Documentation gaps for development workflows

These challenges have delayed the implementation timeline by approximately 4-5 days, impacting the organization's ability to secure funding and maintain development momentum.

#### Gap Analysis

The most critical components still requiring completion are:
1. Voting and proposal mechanism deployment
2. Multisig wallet integration and configuration
3. AI agent integration with governance systems
4. UI elements for governance interaction

These components represent the minimum viable product necessary for organizational operation and funding readiness.

```

## 🔄 Implementation

### 📝 Implementation Steps

1. Reassign development resources to focus exclusively on voting mechanism deployment
2. Engage specialized expertise to resolve multisig wallet integration issues
3. Implement simplified AI governance agent with core functionality only
4. Develop minimal viable UI for governance interaction
5. Establish daily progress tracking and blocker resolution meetings
6. Document development processes to prevent similar delays in future iterations
7. Prioritize elements required for funding readiness over complete feature implementation

### ⏱️ Timeline

- Day 0 (Approval): Reorganization of development resources
- Day 1-3: Intensive focus on voting mechanism deployment
- Day 4-5: Multisig wallet resolution
- Day 6-7: AI agent core functionality implementation
- Day 8-9: UI development for governance interaction
- Day 10: Integration testing and production deployment
