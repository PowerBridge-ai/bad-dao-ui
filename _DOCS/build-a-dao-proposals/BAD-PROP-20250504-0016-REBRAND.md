## üîç Executive Summary

This proposal seeks to rebrand "Build A DAO" (BAD) to "Build A DAO AI" (BADA) to address the negative psychological and marketing connotations associated with the acronym "BAD." The rebranding includes updating the organization's name, logo, and all associated branding materials. An A/B testing approach for two logo variants will be implemented to gather feedback from core team members, board directors, and community members before finalizing the selection. This strategic rebranding aims to create a more positive brand perception while reinforcing our focus on AI integration in DAO structures.

## üìã Proposal Details

### üéØ Objective
To rebrand our organization from "Build A DAO" (BAD) to "Build A DAO AI" (BADA) to eliminate negative connotations associated with the current acronym and better reflect our technological focus on AI integration in decentralized autonomous organizations.

### üìù Description
During a core team meeting on May 4th, 2025 at 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time between Avery, Fabian, and Ruby, concerns were raised about the psychological impact and marketing limitations of the acronym "BAD." The team proposed modifying our name to "Build A DAO AI," resulting in the more positive acronym "BADA."

This rebranding effort will involve:
1. Official name change to "Build A DAO AI"
2. Logo redesign that incorporates the letter "A" into our existing visual identity
3. A/B testing of two logo variants to determine the preferred design
4. Comprehensive update of all digital assets, documentation, and marketing materials
5. A strategic rollout plan to communicate the change to our community and partners

The rebrand maintains our core identity while addressing the negative connotations of the current acronym, presenting us with an opportunity to refresh our brand positioning and emphasize our commitment to AI integration in DAO structures.
