```

The discussion phase is critical for proposal refinement:

### 🗨️ Forum Discussions

1. **Duration**: 7 days minimum (may be extended for complex proposals)
2. **Structure**:
   - Main proposal thread for general feedback
   - Sub-threads for specific aspects (technical, economic, etc.)
   - Categorized feedback (support, concerns, questions)
3. **Facilitation**:
   - Dedicated moderators to maintain constructive discussion
   - Weekly community calls for high-impact proposals
   - Structured Q&A sessions with proposers

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Stakeholder Engagement

1. **Core Teams**: Technical assessment and implementation feasibility
2. **Subject Matter Experts**: Domain-specific analysis
3. **Delegates**: Represent broader community interests
4. **General Token Holders**: Diverse perspectives and feedback

2. **Revision Categories**:
   - **Minor**: Clarifications, small adjustments, additional details
   - **Moderate**: Significant changes that maintain original intent
   - **Major**: Fundamental changes requiring restart of discussion period

3. **Finalization**:
   - Final call for feedback (48 hours)
   - Proposer confirmation of readiness
   - No substantial changes after finalization

### 🔎 Expert Reviews

The voting phase determines community consensus:

### 🗳️ Voting Parameters

Different proposal types have specific voting parameters:

| Proposal Type | Voting Period | Quorum | Approval Threshold | Time-lock |
|---------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Core Protocol Change | 5 days | 15% | 70% | 7 days |
| Treasury Allocation | 5 days | 10% | 60% | 3-7 days |
| Governance Update | 7 days | 20% | 75% | 14 days |
| Working Group | 3 days | 5% | 55% | 2 days |

    style B1,C1,C2,C3,D1,D2,D3,E1,E2,E3 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

Voting power is determined by:

1. **Token Holdings**: Basic voting power from BAD token holdings
2. **Time Weighting**: Multipliers based on token holding duration
   - 30+ days: 1.2x multiplier
   - 90+ days: 1.5x multiplier
   - 180+ days: 2.0x multiplier
3. **Role Multipliers**: Additional weight for certain governance roles
   - Core team members: 1.5x multiplier (for technical proposals)
   - Verified contributors: Role-specific multipliers
4. **Delegation**: Accumulated voting power from delegators

    Note over T,R: Voting Period Opens
    
    alt Direct Voting
        T->>S: Cast Vote (For/Against/Abstain)
        S->>S: Record Vote
        S->>R: Update Results

    Note over T,R: Voting Period Closes
    
    S->>S: Finalize Results
    S->>R: Publish Official Outcome
```

Voting utilizes the following mechanics:

1. **Voting Options**:
   - For: Support for the proposal as presented
   - Against: Opposition to the proposal
   - Abstain: Counted toward quorum but not approval percentage

2. **Voting Methods**:
   - Web interface with wallet connection
   - Direct smart contract interaction
   - Delegation to trusted representatives
   - Snapshot voting for gas-free participation

3. **Vote Privacy**:
   - Votes are publicly visible on-chain
   - Optional private voting via zero-knowledge proofs for select proposals
   - Vote justification field for accountability

4. **Vote Modification**:
   - Votes can be changed until voting period ends
   - Last recorded vote is final
   - Vote change history is publicly visible

### 📈 Voting Analysis

The system provides comprehensive voting analytics:

1. **Participation Metrics**:
   - Overall participation rate
   - Participation by token holding size
   - Participation by holding duration
   - Delegate participation effectiveness

2. **Vote Distribution**:
   - Breakdown by vote option
   - Vote concentration analysis
   - Voting power distribution curve
   - Historical comparison

3. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Voting patterns over time
   - Last-minute voting trends
   - Early vs. late voting comparison
   - Voting momentum visualization

### 🔰 Result Determination

After the voting period concludes:

1. **Automatic Calculation**:
   - Quorum verification: Total votes >= minimum required participation
   - Approval threshold: FOR votes >= required percentage
   - Final verification of all voting parameters

2. **Result Categories**:
   - **Approved**: Met quorum and approval threshold
   - **Rejected**: Met quorum but failed approval threshold
   - **Invalid**: Failed to meet quorum requirement

3. **Result Certification**:
   - Cryptographic verification of voting integrity
   - On-chain finalization of results
   - Permanent record in governance history
   - Official announcement across all channels

The post-implementation phase evaluates outcomes:

### 📈 Performance Tracking

Key metrics are monitored to assess implementation success:

1. **Technical Performance**:
   - System performance metrics
   - Error rates and issues
   - Gas usage optimization
   - Contract interaction patterns

2. **Economic Impact**:
   - Token economics effects
   - Treasury performance
   - Protocol revenue changes
   - Market response

3. **User Engagement**:
   - User adoption metrics
   - Feedback sentiment
   - Support ticket volume
   - Feature usage statistics

### 📝 Implementation Report

A comprehensive report is published after significant implementations:

1. **Implementation Summary**:
   - Original proposal objectives
   - Implementation details
   - Deviations from proposal (if any)
   - Technical challenges and solutions

2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Achieved outcomes vs. expected outcomes
   - Positive effects and benefits
   - Negative effects or issues
   - Unintended consequences

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Key performance indicators
   - Before/after comparison
   - Time-series data analysis
   - Comparative benchmarks

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Follow-up actions required
   - Potential improvements
   - Future proposal considerations
   - Process enhancement suggestions
