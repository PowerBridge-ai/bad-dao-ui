## 📋 Proposal Details

### 🎯 Objective

To restructure the BAD DAO leadership to improve operational effectiveness, project delivery timelines, and funding readiness by aligning roles with demonstrated skills and organizational needs.

### 📝 Description

The Build a DAO organization has identified operational inefficiencies in its current structure that have impeded progress on the critical 14-day bootstrap plan. Through careful evaluation of team dynamics, individual strengths, and project requirements, we have determined that a leadership reorganization will significantly improve our ability to achieve our immediate objectives.

Ruby (Noel) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in administrative coordination, project management, documentation preparation, and organizational understanding. She has effectively filled leadership gaps, maintained project momentum, and shown deep comprehension of the DAO's core concepts, model, and business applications. Her leadership in meetings and ability to keep projects aligned with funding objectives makes her ideally suited for the President role.

Aziz has valuable expertise in business mentorship, project management, and strategic consultation. This restructuring allows him to focus on these strengths while continuing to lead specific projects and contribute to the organization's strategic direction. This role optimization ensures his talents are applied where they provide maximum value.
