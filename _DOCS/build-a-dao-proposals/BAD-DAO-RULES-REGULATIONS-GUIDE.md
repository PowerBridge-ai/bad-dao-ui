## 🎯 Purpose

This guide serves as a practical companion to the BAD DAO Rules and Regulations Framework. It explains the operational aspects of working with the rules and regulations, including management processes, decision workflows, storage protocols, security considerations, and integration with AI systems. This document is intended for:

- Core Team members responsible for governance operations
- Board of Directors and Guardian Council members
- Technical implementers of governance systems
- AI system administrators and developers
- Contributors involved in governance processes

The guide answers practical "how-to" questions rather than defining the rules themselves, which are contained in the main Rules and Regulations Framework document.
