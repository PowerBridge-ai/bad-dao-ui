# 📄 BAD DAO CONTRACT TEMPLATE GUIDE & STANDARD

## 🔍 About This Document

This guide provides the standardized format, structure, and styling for all BAD DAO legal contracts. Following this template ensures consistency, enforceability, and AI integration capabilities across all agreements within the BAD DAO ecosystem.

## 🚀 How To Use This Guide

1. **Copy the template section** below for the basis of any new contract
2. **Replace placeholder text** (anything in brackets like `[THIS]`)
3. **Customize sections** based on contract type (adding or removing as needed)
4. **Maintain formatting conventions** (emojis, headers, structure)
5. **Include the metadata section** for AI integration
6. **Have legal review** before finalization

## 🎨 Styling Conventions

### 📝 Header Hierarchy

- **Document Title**: `# 📄 [DOCUMENT TITLE]` (H1 with relevant emoji)
- **Major Sections**: `## 📋 [SECTION NAME]` (H2 with relevant emoji)
- **Subsections**: `### [SUBSECTION NAME]` (H3)
- **Nested Items**: Use numbered or bulleted lists with consistent indentation

### 🔤 Formatting Standards

- **Monetary Values**: Write in both text and numerals: `**TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($250,000.00)**`
- **Lists**: Use numbered lists (1, 2, 3) for sequential or prioritized items, and bullets for non-sequential items
