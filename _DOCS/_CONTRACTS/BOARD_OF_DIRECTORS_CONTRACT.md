## 🎯 Purpose and Role

### Board Mandate
The Board of Directors serves as the strategic oversight body of BAD DAO, providing governance leadership, domain expertise, and serving as the ultimate arbiter in governance and operational matters. The Board has the potential to accumulate up to 49% of the total governance authority through delegation from community members, while the community (contributors, delegates, and other token holders) retains 51% of governance authority. The AI governance agent serves as a tiebreaker in deadlocked scenarios to facilitate efficient resolution of disputes.

The governance power distribution reflects the following principles:

1. **Core Team Authority**: The Core Team maintains 51% control of governance tokens, with 40% directly accessible and 11% reserved for AI governance operations
   
2. **Delegation Mechanics**: 
   - Contributors can delegate their tokens to specialized delegates to increase voting effectiveness
   - Contributors can apply to become delegates after demonstrating project success and platform contributions
   - Delegates receive revenue sharing from successful proposals under their management
   - Delegate power is capped at 25% of total governance tokens to prevent excessive concentration

3. **Contributor Advancement**:
   - Contributors begin with basic voting rights
   - After successful project completion and positive contribution history, contributors can apply for delegate status
   - Delegates gain enhanced proposal capabilities, higher spending limits, and project treasury management rights
   - Delegates can manage multiple contributors and their respective projects

4. **AI Governance Safeguards**:
   - AI controls 11% of governance tokens for security and tie-breaking
   - AI can veto malicious proposals through the special proposal process
   - AI generates resolution proposals during deadlocks between Core Team and Community
   - Special 48-hour resolution cycle for contested decisions
   - AI provides treasury protection against coordinated attacks

5. **Attack Prevention Mechanisms**:
   - Multi-signature requirements for large treasury movements
   - AI veto power for suspicious transactions
   - Delegation caps to prevent power concentration
   - Cross-exchange attack monitoring and prevention
   - Malicious proposal identification and freezing
