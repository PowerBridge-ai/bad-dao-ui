The Restricted Party acknowledges that the Company operates in a highly specialized environment where competitive advantages are difficult to establish and easily compromised by those with internal knowledge. This Agreement is not intended to unreasonably restrict the Restricted Party's ability to earn a livelihood, but rather to protect the Company's legitimate business interests while providing clear guidelines for compliant post-relationship conduct.

   e. All protocols for departure from relationship with the Company
   
   f. All required disclosures and ongoing obligations post-relationship
