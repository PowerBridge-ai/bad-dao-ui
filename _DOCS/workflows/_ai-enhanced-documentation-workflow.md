## 📝 Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

#### Step 1: Initial Conversation
- Conduct a detailed conversation about the project
- Include stakeholders, developers, and relevant team members
- Cover project goals, requirements, constraints, and timeline
- Discuss technical approach and implementation details
- Explore potential challenges and solutions
- Consider business objectives and success metrics

#### Step 2: Conversation Transcription
- Record the conversation (with permission)
- Transcribe the conversation verbatim
- Preserve all ideas, concerns, and discussion points
- Maintain speaker identification where relevant
- Save the transcription as a raw text file

### Phase 2: AI Processing

#### Step 3: Initial AI Analysis (Chat Review)
- Submit the transcription to ChatGPT (4.0 or 4 Reasoning)
- Use this prompt template:

```
I'm sharing a transcription of a conversation about a project. Please:
1. Summarize the main points of this conversation
2. Identify the core project objectives
3. List key features or components discussed
4. Note any technical requirements mentioned
5. Highlight any unresolved questions or areas needing clarification
6. Organize your response into clear sections with bullet points

Here's the conversation:
[PASTE TRANSCRIPTION HERE]
```

#### Step 4: Expanded Project Overview
- Submit the AI's summary for further expansion with this prompt:

```
Based on this summary, please:
1. Derive comprehensive project goals and objectives
2. Identify specific tasks and subtasks that were discussed
3. Suggest any important aspects that may have been overlooked
4. Propose a high-level timeline if none was discussed
5. Structure this into a formal project overview document with:
   - Executive summary
   - Project scope
   - Core objectives
   - Key deliverables
   - Technical approach
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk assessment
   - Timeline
   - Success metrics

Assume the project is fully funded and prioritize completion speed unless otherwise specified.
```

### Phase 3: Documentation Creation

#### Step 5: Core Documentation Structure
- Create a dedicated project folder with the following structure:

```
project_name/
├── dev/
│   ├── dev.md
│   ├── file-tree.md
│   ├── task-list.md
│   └── task-log.md
├── README.md
└── project-overview.md
```

#### Step 6: Generate Documentation Templates
- Use AI to create initial versions of each document with these prompts:

##### For dev.md:
```
Please create a detailed dev.md document for this project that includes:
1. System architecture overview
2. Component relationships and interactions
3. Implementation status (using emoji indicators)
4. Technical specifications for each component
5. Database schema (if applicable)
6. API endpoints (if applicable)
7. Performance requirements
8. Technical risks and mitigation strategies
9. Development workflows
10. Testing requirements

Use the following mermaid diagrams:
- Component architecture diagram
- Data flow diagram
- Process workflow diagram

Format this as a professional markdown document with clear headings, code blocks, and emoji indicators for status (🔴 Not Started, 🟡 In Progress, 🟢 Completed, ⭕️ Blocked, 🔵 Testing, ✅ Verified).
```

##### For file-tree.md:
```
Please create a file-tree.md document that outlines:
1. The complete directory structure for this project
2. Brief descriptions of each file and directory's purpose
3. Status indicators for implementation (✅ Completed, 🟡 In Progress, 🔴 Not Started)
4. Component relationships and dependencies
5. File groupings by feature or functionality
6. Implementation status metrics
7. Size metrics (where applicable)
8. Feature mapping to files

Format this as a codeblock for the directory structure and use markdown for explanations and status.
```

##### For task-list.md:
```
Based on the project overview, please create a comprehensive task-list.md that:
1. Breaks down all work into clear, actionable tasks
2. Organizes tasks by phase or component
3. Includes detailed acceptance criteria for each task
4. Assigns priority levels (P0-P3) to each task
5. Estimates complexity or effort (1-5) for each task
6. Identifies dependencies between tasks
7. Tags tasks by type (frontend, backend, documentation, etc.)
8. Includes task IDs (e.g. PROJ-001)

Format this as a markdown document with tables, bullet points, and clear organization.
```

##### For task-log.md:
```
Please create a starter task-log.md template that:
1. Includes sections for daily progress updates
2. Has templates for task progress, completion summaries, and technical metrics
3. Includes status indicators for each task
4. Provides sections for risk management
5. Includes performance tracking metrics
6. Has clear cross-references to other documentation files
7. Includes review notes sections
8. Provides structure for next action planning

Use standardized status indicators (🔴 Not Started, 🟡 In Progress, 🟢 Completed, ⭕️ Blocked, 🔵 Testing, ✅ Verified) and include template sections that can be copied and filled in for each update.
```

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates and Maintenance
