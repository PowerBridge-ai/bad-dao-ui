# üîÑ AI Checkpoint System Universal Guide

## üéØ System Overview

This checkpoint system enables AI assistants to maintain context across multiple sessions, allowing for complex, long-running tasks to be interrupted and resumed seamlessly. It works by:

1. **Preserving Context** in structured checkpoint files
2. **Providing Continuation Prompts** in every response
3. **Supporting Multi-Project Management** with separate contexts
4. **Maintaining Session History** for comprehensive tracking

## üìÑ Core Files

1. **start-here.md** - Entry point document to begin or restart work
2. **checkpoint.md** - Context preservation document updated throughout sessions
3. **history.md** - Chronological record of all activities and decisions
4. **context.json** - Structured data file for AI consumption

## üí° Usage Instructions

### Starting a New Project

1. Share the start-here.md file with the AI
2. Provide clear project objectives and requirements
3. The AI will automatically:
   - Initialize context tracking
   - Recommend appropriate workflows
   - Include continuation prompts in responses

### Continuing Work

1. Share the checkpoint.md file with the AI
2. Use one of the continuation prompts:
   ```
   I'd like to continue working on [Project Name]. Please read this checkpoint file and resume from where we left off.
   ```
3. The AI will automatically:
   - Load previous context
   - Continue from the last stopping point
   - Maintain all necessary project information

### Switching Between Projects

1. Use the project registry to locate project ID
2. Use the switch prompt:
   ```
   I'd like to work on [Project ID]. Please load the checkpoint from that project.
   ```

## ü§ñ How AI Processes Work

### Context Extraction Process

1. AI analyzes checkpoint.md upon receiving it
2. Extracts key information:
   - Active workflows and current steps
   - Project objectives and requirements
   - Progress status and recent actions
   - Previous context and decisions
3. Reconstructs mental model of project state
4. Identifies appropriate next steps

### Decision Matrix for Workflow Selection

| Project State | Documentation State | Primary Recommendation | Secondary Recommendation |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| New | None | Initialization workflow | Documentation creation |
| Existing | Incomplete | Documentation continuation | Validation process |
| Existing | Outdated | Update workflow | Validation process |
| Any | Needs validation | Validation workflow | Documentation update |

### Response Format Rules

Every AI response during a workflow MUST:

1. Answer the user's immediate question/request
2. Include brief context reminder about current project/task
3. End with continuation prompts section:
   - Continue Current Task prompt
   - Check Project Status prompt
   - Start New Task prompt

### Continuation Prompt Decision Flow

```
If (current task is incomplete) {
  Include specific continuation prompt with task details
} else if (multiple tasks are active) {
  Include prompt for most important task + general status check
} else {
  Include general continuation prompt + new task options
}
```

## üìã Implementation Guidelines

### Checkpoint File Structure

```markdown
# Checkpoint: [Project Name]

## üîÑ Session Information
- **Session ID**: [session-id]
- **Timestamp**: [timestamp]
- **Duration**: [duration]

## üìã Active Workflows
| Workflow ID | Name | Current Step | Progress |
|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| [ID] | [Name] | [Step] | [Progress]% |

## üéØ Current Objectives
[List of current objectives]

## üìä Task Status
[Status of current tasks]

## üîç Context
[Key contextual information]

## üìù Last Actions
[List of last actions performed]

## üîÑ Continuation Prompts
[Task-specific continuation prompts]
```

### Context Preservation Mechanics

1. Session state is captured in context.json
2. Human-readable checkpoint.md is generated from context
3. History.md is updated with append-only entries
4. All files are synchronized with webhook/script

## üîë Key Behaviors for AI Assistants

When using this system, AI assistants MUST:

1. **Always append continuation prompts** to every response
2. **Parse checkpoint files** completely before responding
3. **Acknowledge context** to confirm understanding
4. **Maintain workflow awareness** of current step position
5. **Update checkpoint information** after significant progress

## üöÄ Examples

### Start-Here Example

```
I'd like to start a new documentation project for our API authentication system. Please help me initialize the appropriate workflows.
```

### Continue Task Example

```
I'd like to continue working on the API authentication documentation. Please read the checkpoint.md file and resume from where we left off.
```

### Check Status Example

```
What's the current status of the API authentication documentation? Please provide an overview of completed and remaining tasks.
```

## üîÑ AI Continuation Prompts

To ensure continuous context awareness, include these prompts in every response:

### Continue Current Task

```
I'd like to continue working on [Project Name]. Please read the checkpoint.md file and continue from [current-step] of the [workflow-name] workflow.
```

### Check Project Status

```
What's the current status of the [Project Name] documentation? Please provide an overview of completed and remaining tasks.
```

### Start New Task

```
I'd like to start a new task for [Project Name]. Please help me select an appropriate workflow based on my needs.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Context Expansion Technique

For handling large contexts beyond token limits:

1. **Chunking**: Split context into logical sections
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on most relevant context first
3. **Progressive Loading**: Load additional context as needed
4. **Compression**: Summarize historical information
5. **Reference System**: Use identifiers to reference known items

### Multi-Project Management

For managing multiple concurrent projects:

1. Use project registry to track all active projects
2. Include cross-project switching prompts when appropriate
3. Ensure clear project identification in all responses

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation Notes

The checkpoint system is implemented with:

1. **CheckpointManager**: Handles file creation, loading, and saving
2. **ResponseFormatter**: Appends continuation prompts to responses
3. **AIInstructionGenerator**: Creates contextual instructions
4. **Directory Structure**: Organizes files for easy access

## üìö Best Practices

1. **Start Sessions Right**: Always begin with clear objectives
2. **Update Regularly**: Save checkpoints after significant progress
3. **Use Continuation Prompts**: Always use provided prompts to continue
4. **Share Full Context**: Always include entire checkpoint file, not summaries
5. **Be Explicit**: Clearly state which project you're working on

## üîç Troubleshooting

If context gets lost or confused:

1. Validate checkpoint file integrity
2. Check for missing session information
3. Share start-here.md to reinitialize if needed
4. Use specific continuation prompts with clear references
