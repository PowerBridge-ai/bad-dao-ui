# üé≤ Core Team Evaluation System - Level One: Team Theory

## üìã Overview

Level One of the Core Team Evaluation System, titled "Team Theory," is a Mario Party-inspired interactive game board experience designed to assess team dynamics through collaborative decision-making and mini-game challenges. This document outlines the gameplay mechanics, UI elements, and assessment metrics for this foundational level.

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### üèÅ Starting the Game

1. **Game Board Introduction**
   - Players are presented with a 3D game board representing the "Team Theory" landscape
   - The board features branching paths with themed zones representing different organizational values
   - Interactive tooltips explain game objectives and mechanics
   - Difficulty selection determines organizational starting resources:
     - Easy: Organization starts with substantial resources (10,000 points)
     - Medium: Organization starts with moderate resources (5,000 points)
     - Hard: Organization starts with minimal resources (2,000 points)
     - Expert: Organization starts with zero resources (0 points)

2. **Player Initialization**
   - Each player receives equal individual resources (1,000 points)
   - Players create/select avatars that represent them on the board
   - Team roles are displayed next to player names
   - Calendar sets a clear deadline for project completion
   - Turn order follows team hierarchy or predefined sequence

### üìÖ Daily Progression System

1. **Calendar Interface**
   - Main progression mechanic is a visual calendar showing project timeline
   - Each turn represents one business day in the project lifecycle
   - Calendar displays:
     - Current day indicator
     - Past days (completed turns) with summary indicators
     - Future days with preview indicators
     - Project deadline with countdown
     - Key milestones throughout the timeline
   - Progress bar shows completion percentage toward final goal

2. **Next Day Mechanism**
   - Players progress by activating the "Next Day" button at the end of their turn
   - Morning briefing animation shows day's challenges and opportunities
   - Daily special events may trigger based on the calendar position
   - No random elements in progression - each day brings predetermined but unknown challenges
   - Calendar highlights weekends and special dates with unique events

3. **Path Selection & Movement**
   - Player advances their avatar along the board for each new day
   - At branch points, player must choose which path to take
   - Paths are color-coded to represent different value priorities:
     - Innovation Path (Purple)
     - Integrity Path (Blue)
     - Collaboration Path (Green)
     - Excellence Path (Gold)
     - User-Focus Path (Orange)
   - Each path has different risk/reward profiles clearly indicated
   - Choosing paths represents daily work prioritization decisions

4. **Decision Points**
   - Each new day presents scenario cards that represent workplace situations
   - Scenario displays a situation relevant to organizational values
   - Player must make an A/B/C multiple-choice decision
   - Decision is displayed to all players for transparency
   - Choice reflects player's alignment with specific organizational values
   - Timer (30 seconds) adds pressure to decision-making
   - Points awarded based on decision quality and alignment with team values

5. **Decision Impact Visualization**
   - After each decision, an animated visualization shows:
     - Impact on individual resources
     - Impact on team alignment
     - Impact on organizational resources
     - Calendar consequences (some decisions may add or remove days from timeline)
   - Visual feedback reinforces consequences of choices

### üéØ Mini-Games ("Side Quests")

1. **Mini-Game Trigger**
   - At the end of each day (turn), player triggers a team mini-game
   - Mini-game type is influenced by the player's path and decisions
