Aragon DAO Setup: A Build Guide
77 sources
The provided texts comprehensively outline the planning and development of the "BAD DAO," a decentralized autonomous organization intended for AI project incubation and revenue generation. The documentation includes guides for building the DAO on Aragon, detailed technical specifications of its smart contracts and frontend, the project's file structure, and task logs tracking development progress. Furthermore, it contains a 14-day implementation plan and a validation report focusing on the alignment of token creation parameters with Aragon's platform and the project's objectives. These sources collectively present a thorough overview of the DAO's design, technical underpinnings, and implementation strategy.

Can you look over the Dow dev guide and basically do a gap analysis we want to figure out exactly what the accuracy of chatty BT was when referencing the overall objective and project parameters for the build a DAO project or BAD , I need you to specifically cite any lines or any topics that are in the build Adobe Dow Dev guy that I shared with you it's the last document or last two documents that I shared with you go ahead and do a full gap analysis with a source validation I need all the sources to understand exactly what it's hallucinated and what's not and then give it an overall percentage score plus steps to correct the hallucinated content use the 14 day implementation checklist and the new founders guide as your source of truth

Based on your query, I will perform a gap analysis of the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" against the "14-day-implementation-checklist.md" and the "new-founders-guide (1).pdf" to assess the accuracy of "chatty BT" when referencing the overall objectives and project parameters for the Build a DAO (BAD) project. The "14-day implementation checklist" and the "new founders guide" will serve as our source of truth.
Analysis of "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" against the Source of Truth:
The "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" primarily focuses on identifying potential gaps and best practices for developing a DAO, rather than explicitly outlining the objectives and parameters of a specific DAO like BAD. Therefore, a direct comparison of objectives and parameters is not entirely feasible. However, we can analyze if the concerns and recommendations in the dev guide align with the implementation steps and considerations presented in the "14-day implementation checklist" and the "new founders guide."
1. Overall Objective and Project Parameters from the Source of Truth:
‚Ä¢
14-day Implementation Checklist: The overall objective is the complete setup of the BAD DAO within a 14-day timeline. Key project parameters evident from the checklist include:
‚ó¶
Rapid implementation: A structured day-by-day plan for a two-week setup.
‚ó¶
Token development: Creation and deployment of the BAD token with specific parameters and vesting.
‚ó¶
Network selection: Choosing between Sepolia for testing and Ethereum for production. Base network is also considered as per other sources like.
‚ó¶
Hackathon integration: Setting up integration with a Hackathon Discovery API.
‚ó¶
Revenue integration: Implementing success fee calculation and treasury allocation for grants.
‚ó¶
Governance testing: Comprehensive testing of proposal types, voting thresholds, and permissions.
‚ó¶
Security focus: Running security analysis on contracts and preparing for a security audit.
‚ó¶
Comprehensive documentation: Creating user guides, technical documentation, and documenting audit findings.
‚Ä¢
New Founders Guide: This guide provides general advice for startup founders on vision, strategy, product development, team building, funding, and growth. While it emphasizes the importance of clear vision and milestones, it does not contain specific objectives or parameters for the BAD DAO project. Its content is more broadly applicable to building any company.
2. Gap Analysis of "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md":
The "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" highlights several critical aspects of DAO development, which can be loosely mapped to the BAD implementation process:
‚Ä¢
Deployment Lifecycle: The dev guide points out the lack of clarity on deployment order and tools. The "14-day implementation checklist" implicitly follows a lifecycle (Setup, Token, Integration, Governance, etc.) but doesn't explicitly detail deployment tools or the exact order of smart contract deployment.
‚Ä¢
Fallback or Recovery Logic: The dev guide mentions the need for explicit fallback logic. The checklist includes security audits which could identify areas needing recovery mechanisms, but doesn't mandate specific fallback implementations.
‚Ä¢
Timelock Logic: The dev guide asks for clarification on execution delays. While not explicitly in the initial 14-day checklist, other sources mention a 2-day timelock, indicating this is considered in BAD's technical design.
‚Ä¢
ProposalRegistry Enforcement: The dev guide questions if the proposal registry verifies proposal outcomes. The checklist focuses on testing governance workflows, implying a system to track and enforce decisions, but the technical details of a ProposalRegistry are not in this checklist.
‚Ä¢
Oracle/Input Flow: The dev guide asks about the use of oracles for external data. The "14-day implementation checklist" doesn't mention reliance on external data feeds in its initial phase.
‚Ä¢
Function Examples and Sequence Diagrams: The dev guide recommends adding code examples and diagrams. The checklist is a task-oriented breakdown and doesn't include these technical details.
‚Ä¢
Gas/Mobile/Tooling/Network Considerations: The dev guide emphasizes these aspects. The "14-day implementation checklist" mentions network selection and other sources specify Base for lower gas costs, indicating gas efficiency is a consideration. Mobile-first design and detailed tooling compatibility are not explicitly mentioned in the 14-day checklist.
3. Source Validation and Identification of Hallucinated Content:
Since the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" does not make claims about the BAD DAO's specific objectives and parameters as defined by our source of truth, it's not possible to directly identify hallucinated content related to BAD's objectives and parameters within the dev guide itself.
However, if "chatty BT" attributed any of the general concerns or recommendations from the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" as being specific, already addressed, or core objectives of the BAD DAO without direct support in the "14-day implementation checklist" or the high-level vision of the "new founders guide," that would constitute a hallucination.
For example, if "chatty BT" claimed the BAD DAO already has a clearly defined and implemented fallback logic specifically because the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" recommends it, and this is not explicitly detailed in the "14-day implementation checklist," then that would be a potential hallucination.
4. Overall Percentage Score:
Without knowing the specific claims made by "chatty BT," it's impossible to provide an accurate percentage score for hallucinated content. The "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" serves as a checklist of considerations for DAO development, and its alignment with the BAD project's specifics would depend on how BAD addresses these considerations in its broader architecture and implementation (beyond just the 14-day initial phase).
5. Steps to Correct Hallucinated Content:
To correct any hallucinated content by "chatty BT," the following steps should be taken:
1.
Identify the specific claims made by "chatty BT" about the BAD DAO's objectives or parameters, particularly those that seem to stem from the topics discussed in the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md."
2.
Compare each claim to the "14-day implementation checklist" and the "new-founders-guide (1).pdf". These are your sources of truth for the initial phase and high-level vision.
3.
For any claim not directly supported by these sources, flag it as potentially hallucinated.
4.
Consult other BAD DAO documentation (like the technical implementation guide, system architecture, or dev notes) to see if the claim is supported elsewhere, even if not in the initial 14-day plan or high-level founder's guide.
5.
If a claim remains unsupported by any provided source, clarify that the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" offers general best practices, and the specific implementation details for BAD should be verified against BAD-specific documentation.
6.
Use the "14-day implementation checklist" and the "new founders guide" to provide the accurate objectives and parameters for the BAD DAO project, emphasizing the initial 14-day implementation goals and the broader vision of empowering the shift to Web3.
By following these steps, you can systematically identify and correct any inaccuracies in "chatty BT"'s statements regarding the BAD DAO project, using the provided sources as your guide. Remember that the "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md" is a helpful list of considerations, but it doesn't describe the specifics of the BAD DAO itself.
Can you give me a immediate checklist that I can give to my ai assistant that's going to systematically go in and go validate all of our current charter and current documentation for the build of Dow Dev and make sure that you have all of these source materials that you need instead of me telling you what to use as a source of truth you have 18 million tokens you can figure it out so go through all of the documentation out and fully source everything then give me a step by step checklist to give to my ai agent citing each document that needs to be changed the line that needs to be changed and make sure that whatever we have for the current or next documents that we need to make that we can move forward with the same implementation step to make sure that we have low hallucination and high enough documentation source validation

Don't forget to provide your AI assistant with access to all the documents, including "üìú BuildaDAO Charter (Full DAO-Level Charter).md"!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, let's proceed with the validation and gap analysis of the "üìú BuildaDAO Charter (Full DAO-Level Charter).md".
Based on the charter, here are some observations and potential areas for further consideration and gap analysis against the other documents:
‚úÖ Strengths and Positive Aspects of the Charter:
‚Ä¢
Clear Purpose and Vision: The charter clearly defines the mission and vision of BuildaDAO, focusing on empowering communities in the Global South to launch DAOs. This aligns with the broader goals outlined in other documents like the "Build a DAO [BaD] Whitepaper.md" and "What are we doing at Build a DAO_.md".
‚Ä¢
Defined DAO Structure: It outlines membership tiers, the potential for SubDAOs and working groups, and considers a legal wrapper, providing a foundational organizational structure. This touches upon concepts mentioned in "DAODiSM Articles of Association.md" regarding operational structure.
‚Ä¢
Established Governance Process: The charter details proposal submission, voting power mechanisms (token-based, reputation-based), and includes emergency veto provisions. This aligns with the governance discussions in "BAD-Aragon-DAO-Implementation-Guide.md" and "Checks and Balances to Keep a DAO Authentic.md".
‚Ä¢
Emphasis on Automation and AI: The inclusion of a section on prompt frameworks and automation aligns with the focus on AI-powered tools in documents like "How BaD generates revenue (AI Powered).md" and "project-overview.md".
‚Ä¢
Commitment to Transparency and Audits: The charter mandates monthly treasury dashboards and regular audits, reflecting the "UADILIFU ‚Äì TRANSPARENCY & TRUST" pillar of DAODiSM and aligning with concepts in "TO DO_ Comprehensive List of Treasury Documents Needed.md".
‚Ä¢
Focus on Education and Onboarding: Defining contributor pathways and training materials is consistent with BaD's educational mission described in "What are we doing at Build a DAO_.md" and the DAODiSM Curriculum Overview.
‚Ä¢
Consideration of Interoperability: Mentioning integration with various DAO tools indicates a forward-thinking approach to the ecosystem.
‚Ä¢
Mechanism for Amendments: Defining how the charter can evolve through DAO votes ensures its longevity and adaptability, echoing the "Evolution & Adaptability" objective in "BaD Objectives.md".
‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Gaps and Areas for Further Analysis:
‚Ä¢
Specificity of Tokenomics: While the charter mentions token-based voting, it doesn't detail the specific tokenomics (initial supply, distribution, etc.). This information should be consistent with documents like "bootstrap-token-implementation-guide.md" and any finalized token parameters. Action: Ensure the charter references or aligns with a detailed tokenomics document.
‚Ä¢
Treasury Management Details: The charter mentions monthly treasury dashboards but lacks specifics on the treasury structure (number of wallets, keyholders), fund allocation percentages, and spending policies. This should align with discussions in "BAD-Aragon-DAO-Implementation-Guide.md" and potential treasury templates. Action: Cross-reference with treasury management policies and ensure consistency.
‚Ä¢
Role and Reputation System Details: While role-weighted voting and escalating roles are mentioned, the specifics of how reputation is earned, Steward roles are defined, and delegation works are not detailed in the charter itself. Action: Ensure these mechanisms are elaborated in supporting documentation and aligned with the charter's principles.
‚Ä¢
Legal Wrapper Implementation: The legal wrapper is marked as "TBD". Once a decision is made, the charter should be updated to reflect the chosen legal structure and its implications for governance and operations, aligning with questions raised in "Key Compliance Questions for a Lawyer Regarding BaD DAO.md". Action: Update the charter once the legal structure is finalized.
‚Ä¢
AI Agent Permissions and Limitations: While the charter mentions AI agents operating through prompts, it could benefit from a clearer outline of the scope of their authority, any limitations, and accountability mechanisms to prevent unintended actions, especially in areas like treasury and governance. Action: Define the operational boundaries and oversight for AI agents.
‚Ä¢
Emergency Procedures in Detail: The emergency veto role is mentioned, but the specific scenarios that would trigger its use, the process for enacting it, and any checks and balances around it could be further elaborated. This relates to the "Missing Fallback or Recovery Logic" point in "‚úÖ DAO Developer Guide.md". Action: Detail the emergency procedures and safeguards.
‚Ä¢
Integration Specifics: While interoperability is mentioned, specific integration workflows with tools like Snapshot, Tally, and Gnosis Zodiac could be referenced or detailed in supporting documentation to provide clarity on how these systems work together within the BuildaDAO framework, connecting to the "Integration Setup" in "BAD-Aragon-DAO-Implementation-Guide.md". Action: Provide more specifics on key integrations in supporting documents.
‚Ä¢
Relationship with DAODiSM Principles: While the charter's spirit aligns with DAODiSM's values, explicitly referencing the core principles or "Be-Attitudes" within the charter could further solidify the foundational ethos of BuildaDAO. Action: Consider referencing core DAODiSM principles in the charter's preamble or purpose section.
By addressing these potential gaps and ensuring consistency with other detailed documentation, you can further strengthen the "üìú BuildaDAO Charter (Full DAO-Level Charter).md" and provide a more comprehensive and robust foundation for your DAO.
This is very very close but you have failed to actually do proper documentation citation with proper line referencing the same way we would do code review for commits so I need you to dial that back I know that's a really cool interface that you have where you can just put numbers like a Bible verse all off in there and index everything but I need the indexes visual so I can just copy and paste them into another markdown and hand them directly to my ai agent so you need to take this information reformat it and when you're referencing each document and citing each line in the document please actually put document name slide number issue and keep that format listing them all with a number issue you can tag the issue as well so we have a consistent formula 001 dash 1 issue or dash I you can use that format for the numbering of the issues put them in a table please and make sure that I can make this easy and simple have a start here paragraph for the AI to orient itself and then have a recontextualization paragraph that allows the AI agent if it is pulled off task to come back to task checking the task log and the task list documents as well as the checkpoint document

Okay, I understand. You need the documentation citations to be explicitly formatted with the document name, slide number (which I will infer from the markdown structure as line numbers), issue number, and an optional issue tag, presented in a table format. This is to facilitate direct use by an AI agent for code review style commit documentation.
Start Here: This response provides a structured overview of information extracted from the provided sources, with each point explicitly cited. The citations follow the format [Document Name] line [Line Number] issue [Issue Number] - [Issue Tag], presented in a table for easy parsing.
Recontextualization: If the AI agent's focus shifts away from the primary objective, it should refer back to the task-log.md, task-log2.md, and any checkpoint documents (like token-validation-checkpoint-01.md) to realign with the current implementation status and priorities.
Here is the reformatted information based on the sources:
