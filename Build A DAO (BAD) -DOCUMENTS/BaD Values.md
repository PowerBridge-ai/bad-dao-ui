### **“Build a DAO” values help shape the culture, decisions, and behavior of the people within a decentralized autonomous organization. These values act like the *operating system* for how the community works together, makes decisions, resolves conflict, and grows.**

### **Here are core DAO values many successful DAOs adopt, especially those focused on *building* together:**

### 

### **🌐 1\. Decentralization**

* Power is distributed, not concentrated.

* Anyone can contribute, and no one entity controls the DAO.

* Transparency and open access are non-negotiable.

### **🛠️ 2\. Build in Public**

* Share work early, get feedback often.

* Transparency over perfection.

* Public roadmaps, open-source code, visible governance.

### **🔑 3\. Ownership & Accountability**

* Everyone takes responsibility for their contributions.

* Shared success \= shared ownership (through tokens, NFTs, etc.).

* If you say you’ll do something — do it, or ask for help.

### **🧠 4\. Continuous Learning**

* Be curious, not certain.

* Share knowledge and upskill each other.

* Mistakes are expected — we grow from them.

### **🫂 5\. Community First**

* People over protocol.

* Prioritize psychological safety, inclusion, and accessibility.

* Decisions consider community impact, not just tech or money.

### **🤝 6\. Collaboration Over Competition**

* We win together.

* Empower others to take initiative.

* Open invitations, not gatekeeping.

### **💡 7\. Experimentation & Innovation**

* Try new things — fast, small, and often.

* Don’t fear failure; embrace iteration.

* Move from idea → action → feedback → evolve.

### **⚖️ 8\. Fairness & Equity**

* Equity isn’t always equality — uplift the underrepresented.

* Design systems that reward effort, not just popularity or politics.

* Create pathways for new contributors to rise.

### **🪞 9\. Transparency**

* Open finances, open governance, open records.

* Decisions are documented and discoverable.

* Trust is built by visibility and consistency.

### **🌱 10\. Sustainability**

* Think long-term: financially, socially, and ecologically.

* Don’t burn people out — build at a human pace.

* Create systems that can outlast individuals.
