# Build a DAO \[BaD\] Whitepaper

## Abstract

Build a DAO \[BaD\] is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to incubate meaningful Web3 projects in Africa while nurturing a community of developers and non-developers. By leveraging blockchain-native principles, AI-powered tools, and a structured Web2-to-Web3 migration package, BaD addresses the lack of viable Web3 projects in Africa and fosters economic empowerment, education, and innovation. This whitepaper outlines BaD’s vision, mission, ecosystem, governance model, tokenomics, and roadmap, while documenting the DAO-building process as a resource for the global Web3 community.
