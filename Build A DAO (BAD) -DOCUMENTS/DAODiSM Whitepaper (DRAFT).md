## **1\. Introduction**

### **The Web3 Revolution & The Need for DaoDism**

The transition from Web2 to Web3 represents a fundamental shift in how technology, governance, and ownership function. However, many businesses, creators, and individuals struggle with adoption due to knowledge gaps, lack of ownership protections, and the complexity of decentralized systems.

DaoDism is a decentralized movement designed to address these challenges by integrating **Web3 education, decentralized governance, and economic empowerment** into a scalable and inclusive ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), DaoDism ensures fair access, transparency, and sustainability for all participants.
