### **1\. Fully On-Chain Governance**

* NounsDAO operates entirely on-chain, meaning all governance decisions, proposals, and treasury allocations are executed through smart contracts.  
* This eliminates reliance on multisigs or off-chain decision-making, ensuring true decentralization.

### **2\. One Noun, One Vote**

* Each Noun NFT represents one vote in the DAO, preventing centralization of power and ensuring equal participation in governance.  
* Proposals require a quorum of votes to pass, fostering active participation from the community.

### **3\. Self-Sustaining Treasury**

* The DAO is funded through daily Noun auctions, where 100% of proceeds go directly to the treasury.  
* This continuous funding model ensures long-term sustainability without dependence on external fundraising.

### **4\. Proposal and Execution Mechanism**

* Any Noun holder can create a proposal, which the community votes on.  
* Once approved, proposals are automatically executed via smart contracts without intermediaries.

### **5\. Delegation System**

* To encourage participation from those who may not be actively engaged, Noun holders can delegate their voting power to trusted community members.

### **6\. Public and Transparent Governance**

* All proposals, votes, and treasury transactions are visible on-chain, ensuring transparency and accountability.  
* Discussions take place in public forums and governance platforms like Discourse and Snapshot.

### **7\. Modular and Upgradeable Governance**

* NounsDAO continues to evolve through governance proposals that refine its structure and improve efficiency while maintaining decentralization.
