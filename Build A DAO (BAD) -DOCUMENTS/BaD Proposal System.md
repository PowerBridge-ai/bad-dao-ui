### **BaD Proposal System**

The **BaD proposal system** is structured to ensure **decentralized, transparent, and effective decision-making** while maintaining security and efficiency. Here’s an overview of how it works:

---

### **1\. Proposal Creation**

* Any BaD holder can **submit a proposal** on-chain, but they must hold **at least 2 BaDs** or have delegated votes meeting this threshold.  
* Proposals detail funding requests, governance changes, community initiatives, or protocol upgrades.  
* The proposal includes:  
  * **Title & Description**: Clear and concise explanation of the idea.  
  * **Actions & On-Chain Execution**: Code that executes once approved.  
  * **Funding Request (if any)**: Amount and purpose of funds from the treasury.

---

### **2\. Proposal Submission & Voting Process**

* **Proposal enters a 2-day review period** before voting starts.  
* Voting lasts for **5 days** where BaD holders can vote:  
  * **For** ✅ (Approve)  
  * **Against** ❌ (Reject)  
  * **Abstain** ⚪ (Neutral)  
* **Quorum Requirement**: A proposal must reach a **20% quorum** of all active BaDs to be valid.  
* **Simple Majority**: The proposal passes if it gets more "For" votes than "Against."

---

### **3\. Execution of Approved Proposals**

* Once a proposal passes, **a 2-day timelock** ensures the community has time to react before execution.  
* After the timelock, the proposal **executes automatically** on-chain via smart contracts—no manual intervention required.

---

### **4\. Proposal Delegation & Governance Upgrades**

* **Delegation:** BaD holders can delegate their votes to trusted members if they cannot actively participate.  
* **Continuous Evolution:** Governance upgrades (e.g., adjusting quorum, voting duration) can be proposed and implemented via the same process.

### **Key Features That Ensure Decentralization & Efficiency**

✅ **Fully On-Chain Governance** – No multisig control, all actions are transparent.  
 ✅ **Equal Voting Power** – Each BaD \= 1 Vote, preventing centralized control.  
 ✅ **Self-Sustaining Treasury** – Funded through daily auctions, enabling long-term development.
