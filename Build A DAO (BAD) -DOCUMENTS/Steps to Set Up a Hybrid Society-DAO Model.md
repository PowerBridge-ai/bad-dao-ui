### **Steps to Set Up a Hybrid Society-DAO Model**

#### **1\. Legal & Organizational Structure**

âœ… **Register a Legal Entity**

* Choose a jurisdiction that recognizes DAOs or is friendly to Web3 organizations (e.g., Wyoming DAO LLC, Switzerland Foundation, Singapore).  
* Define the legal structure (LLC, Foundation, Association).

âœ… **Draft Governance Documents**

* **Bylaws for the legal entity** (covering roles, responsibilities, and compliance).  
* **DAO Governance Framework** (detailing token voting, proposal mechanisms, treasury management).

âœ… **Set Up Banking & Treasury**

* Traditional **bank account** for fiat transactions.  
* **Multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe)** for managing on-chain funds.  
* Consider a **stablecoin reserve** to bridge fiat and crypto funding.

#### **2\. DAO & Web3 Governance Setup**

âœ… **Choose a Blockchain & Tech Stack**

* Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, or another L2 for cost efficiency.  
* DAO management tools: Aragon, Snapshot, Tally, Gnosis Safe.  
* Token standard: ERC-20 for governance, ERC-721/1155 for membership NFTs.

âœ… **Design Governance Mechanisms**

* **Token-based voting** (1 token \= 1 vote, or quadratic voting).  
* **Membership Tiers** (token-gated access based on reputation, stake, or contribution).  
* **Proposal & Treasury Management** using smart contracts.

âœ… **Build a Community Portal**

* **Off-chain discussions** (Discord, Discourse, Telegram).  
* **On-chain governance** (Snapshot for voting, Tally for execution).

---

#### **3\. Funding & Tokenomics**

âœ… **Raise Initial Funds**

* Crowdfunding, grants, token sales (private or public).  
* Partnerships with investors, grants from blockchain ecosystems.

âœ… **Launch a Governance Token**

* Define supply, distribution, and utility.  
* Vesting schedules and staking incentives.

âœ… **Monetization Strategies**

* Membership dues (NFT passes, subscriptions).  
* Revenue-sharing models (e.g., staking rewards, DAO fees).
