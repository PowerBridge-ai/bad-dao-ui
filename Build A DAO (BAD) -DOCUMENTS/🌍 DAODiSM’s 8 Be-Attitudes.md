# **🌍 DaoDism’s 8 Be-Attitudes**

***“Be the change. Be the movement. Be the future.”***

### **1️⃣ Be Sovereign 🔑**

*"He who owns his future fears no master."*

* Own your **identity, assets, and decisions**—never let a third party control what is rightfully yours.  
* **Self-custody is power. Decentralization is freedom.**

### **2️⃣ Be Transparent 🔍**

*"A clear river does not hide its path."*

* Act with honesty, integrity, and openness—**what is built on-chain must be accountable to the people.**  
* **No hidden deals, no secrecy—only truth, only trust.**

### **3️⃣ Be a Builder 🛠️**

*"If the house leaks, the wise man fixes the roof."*

* **Do not wait for change—build it.**  
* Whether it’s a smart contract, a community, or a movement, **your hands shape the future.**

### **4️⃣ Be Collaborative 🤝**

*"When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion."*

* **Web3 is not for individuals—it is for the collective.**  
* Share knowledge, uplift others, and **grow the ecosystem together.**

### **5️⃣ Be Bold 🔥**

*"A lion does not ask permission to roar."*

* Disrupt, innovate, and **challenge outdated systems.**  
* **Do not fear the unknown—Web3 belongs to the fearless.**

### **6️⃣ Be Generous 💰**

*"A tree does not eat its own fruit."*

* Decentralization means **wealth, knowledge, and power must flow freely to all.**  
* **Lift as you rise—what you give strengthens the whole.**

### **7️⃣ Be Adaptive 🌊**

*"A wise river flows around the rock, not through it."*

* **Web3 is an experiment—embrace change, evolve, and iterate.**  
* **Rigidity breaks, but flexibility endures.**

### **8️⃣ Be Rooted in Culture 🌱**

*"A people without knowledge of their past are like a tree without roots."*

* **African wisdom, Ubuntu, and storytelling are part of the digital revolution.**  
* **Technology alone does not define us—our heritage, creativity, and unity do.**
