```

The framework leverages the BAD token as the primary governance instrument, with varying proposal types requiring different quorum and approval thresholds. The system incorporates time-weighted voting, delegation capabilities, and specialized governance roles to ensure both broad participation and domain expertise in decision-making.

## üéØ Objectives

The BAD DAO Governance Framework aims to:

1. Create a sustainable and effective decision-making structure
2. Align incentives between different stakeholder groups
3. Enable broad participation while maintaining expertise-driven decisions
4. Establish clear accountability and responsibility channels
5. Leverage AI to enhance governance efficiency and objectivity
6. Ensure fair token distribution with appropriate vesting mechanisms
7. Automate routine governance functions to reduce overhead

    "Core Team" : 15
    "Contributors" : 10
    "Early Adopters" : 5
    "Treasury" : 40
    "Community" : 30
```

| Treasury | 40% | 40,000,000 | Fund ongoing development and operations |
| Community | 30% | 30,000,000 | Ensure broad distribution and participation |

```

**üî∂ Core Team Vesting**:
- 36-month vesting period
- 6-month cliff
- Linear monthly vesting thereafter
- Revocable upon departure with governance approval

**üî∑ Contributor Vesting**:
- 24-month vesting period
- 3-month cliff
- Linear monthly vesting
- Role-specific accelerated vesting based on contribution milestones

**üë• Early Adopter Vesting**:
- 12-month vesting period
- No cliff
- Linear monthly vesting

**üè¶ Treasury**:
- No vesting (controlled by governance)
- Subject to spending limits and time-locks

**üåê Community**:

## ü§ù Delegation System

### üîÑ Delegation Mechanics

    participant üë§ TokenHolder
    participant üìú DelegationContract
    participant üßë‚Äçüíº Delegate
    participant üèõÔ∏è GovernanceSystem
    
    üë§ TokenHolder->>üìú DelegationContract: Delegate Voting Power
    üìú DelegationContract->>üìú DelegationContract: üîí Lock Delegation (7-day minimum)
    üìú DelegationContract->>üßë‚Äçüíº Delegate: Increase Delegate Voting Power
    üßë‚Äçüíº Delegate->>üèõÔ∏è GovernanceSystem: Vote on Proposals
    üèõÔ∏è GovernanceSystem->>üìú DelegationContract: Record Voting Activity
    üìú DelegationContract->>üë§ TokenHolder: Calculate Delegation Rewards
    üìú DelegationContract->>üßë‚Äçüíº Delegate: Calculate Delegate Rewards
    
    alt üîÑ Revocation
        üë§ TokenHolder->>üìú DelegationContract: Request Delegation Revocation
        üìú DelegationContract->>üìú DelegationContract: ‚è±Ô∏è Wait for Lock Period
        üìú DelegationContract->>üßë‚Äçüíº Delegate: Decrease Delegate Voting Power
        üìú DelegationContract->>üë§ TokenHolder: Return Full Voting Power
    end
```

The delegation system enables token holders to delegate their voting power to specialized delegates without transferring token ownership.

**Key Features**:
- Time-locked delegation with minimum 7-day commitment
- Performance-based delegation incentives (0.5-2% APY)
- Maximum delegation cap per delegate (5% of total supply)
- Delegate reputation system based on participation and voting alignment
- Ability to split delegation among multiple delegates

### üéÅ Delegation Incentives

To encourage active delegation and expert governance participation:

1. **üèÜ Delegate Rewards**: Active delegates receive rewards from the governance incentive pool based on:
   - Number of tokens delegated to them
   - Participation rate in governance votes
   - Longevity of service as delegate
   - Community feedback scores

2. **üíé Delegator Rewards**: Token holders who delegate receive:
   - Base APY for delegation (0.2%)
   - Performance bonus when delegates vote according to proposals that pass
   - Loyalty bonuses for long-term delegation to the same delegate

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Slashing Conditions**: Delegates may face reduced rewards or reputation penalties for:
   - Missing critical votes
   - Voting against overwhelming consensus without explanation
   - Acting against documented delegate principles

   - Contributor rewards
   - Ecosystem grants

2. **üìà Revenue Distribution**: Automatic allocation of incoming revenue:
   - 50% to operational treasury
   - 30% to development fund

   - 5% to emergency reserves

3. **‚öñÔ∏è Treasury Rebalancing**: Automated maintenance of target allocation ratios between:
   - Stable assets (USDC, DAI) - 40%
   - Protocol native tokens - 30%
   - Blue-chip crypto assets (ETH, BTC) - 20%
   - High-potential investments - 10%

### üîí Treasury Governance Controls

1. **üí∞ Spending Limits**:
   - Core team: Up to 1% of treasury per month without full governance
   - Working groups: Predetermined budgets with milestone-based releases
   - Emergency fund: Up to 2% with multi-sig approval for critical issues

2. **‚è±Ô∏è Time-Locks**:
   - 24-hour delay for transactions under 1% of treasury
   - 72-hour delay for transactions between 1-5% of treasury
   - 7-day delay for transactions over 5% of treasury

3. **üëÅÔ∏è Oversight Mechanisms**:
   - Quarterly treasury audits
   - Real-time dashboard for treasury movements
   - AI monitoring for anomalous transactions

```

Voting power in the BAD DAO is calculated through a combination of token ownership, time-weighted holding, role multipliers, and delegation behaviors.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time-Weighted Voting

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Token Holding Period] --> B[30+ Days]
    A --> C[90+ Days]
    A --> D[180+ Days]
    
    B --> B1[1.2x Multiplier]
    C --> C1[1.5x Multiplier]
    D --> D1[2.0x Multiplier]
    
    B1 --> E[Voting Power Calculation]
    C1 --> E
    D1 --> E
    
    E --> F[Final Voting Weight]
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B,C,D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B1,C1,D1 fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E,F fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Time-weighted voting incentivizes long-term commitment to the protocol by increasing voting power based on token holding duration:

- Tokens held for 30+ days: 1.2x voting power
- Tokens held for 90+ days: 1.5x voting power
- Tokens held for 180+ days: 2.0x voting power

This mechanism reduces the influence of short-term token holders and rewards long-term stakeholders who are more likely to vote in the best interest of the protocol's future.

### üìà Delegation System

    style D,E,F fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G,H fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

The delegation system allows token holders to transfer their voting power to specialized delegates without transferring token ownership. This creates an efficient division of labor where token holders can maintain their governance rights while delegating the active participation to experts who specialize in governance activities.

The protocol implements multiple security controls to protect against both technical exploits and governance attacks:

1. **üîë Multi-signature Requirements**: Different treasury thresholds require different levels of multi-sig approval
2. **‚è≥ Time-lock Mechanisms**: All critical changes include appropriate time delays before execution
3. **üìä Graduated Security Thresholds**: Security controls that scale with potential impact
4. **üõë Circuit Breakers**: Automatic protection mechanisms that trigger on unusual activity
