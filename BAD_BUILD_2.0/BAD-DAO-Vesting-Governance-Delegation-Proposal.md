## 🔍 Overview

This proposal outlines the comprehensive vesting, governance, and delegation framework for the BAD DAO. Building on our existing Aragon-based infrastructure and BAD governance token, this document establishes the organizational roles, token distribution strategy, qualification processes, and automated workflows necessary to create a self-sustaining, AI-enhanced decentralized autonomous organization focused on revenue generation through grant writing and hackathon participation.

With our 14-day implementation timeline in mind, this proposal prioritizes essential functionality while establishing a foundation for future enhancements. The framework emphasizes automated decision-making processes, qualification-based role assignment, and transparent treasury management to minimize gatekeeping and enable autonomous operations.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Define clear organizational roles with associated responsibilities and voting power
2. Establish transparent token vesting and distribution mechanisms
3. Create systematic qualification processes for each organizational role
4. Implement delegation mechanisms for voting power optimization
5. Integrate AI agents into governance workflows for enhanced automation
6. Establish treasury management automation for revenue operations
7. Design scalable governance mechanisms that can evolve with the organization

### Revenue Distribution Automation

1. **Revenue Collection Workflow**:
   - Smart contract receives all project revenue in USDT
   - Incoming funds are categorized by source (grants, hackathons, services)
   - AI treasury agent verifies transaction source and amount
   - Funds are automatically allocated based on revenue type

2. **Distribution Percentages**:

| Revenue Source | Operating Wallet | Growth Wallet | Reserve Wallet |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Grant Success Fees | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| Hackathon Platform Fees | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| Service Revenue | 70% | 20% | 10% |

3. **Automated Payout System**:
   - Team member payouts executed via smart contract based on:
     - Role-based base compensation
     - Project completion bonuses
     - Contribution metrics
   - Requires multi-signature approval for amounts over $5,000
   - Weekly automatic distribution for amounts under threshold
   - Transparent payout ledger accessible to all members

### Treasury Security Measures

1. **Multi-signature Requirements**:
   - Operating Wallet: 3/5 signers (2 board members, 1 committee member, 2 AI agents)
   - Growth Wallet: 3/5 signers (2 board members, 2 committee members, 1 AI agent)
   - Reserve Wallet: 4/6 signers (3 board members, 2 committee members, 1 AI agent)

2. **Transaction Limits**:
   - AI-only approval: Up to $500
   - Single board member + AI: Up to $2,000
   - Multiple signatures: Required for larger amounts
   - Weekly spending limits by category
   - Cooling period for transactions over $10,000

3. **Treasury Monitoring**:
   - 24/7 AI monitoring of all wallets
   - Anomaly detection for unusual transaction patterns
   - Daily balance and transaction reports
   - Quarterly treasury audit by external provider
   - Emergency freeze mechanism for suspicious activity
