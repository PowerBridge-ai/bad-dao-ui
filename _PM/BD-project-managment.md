# 📝 Community Data Collection & Survey Automation

## 📋 Ongoing Community Surveys & Data Streams
- **Purpose:** Continuously gather valuable community/user data and opinions through non-intrusive, incentivized surveys
- **Mechanism:**

- **Incentives:**
  - Users earn tokens for each completed survey (tokens can be cashed out once platform/sponsor pays)
  - Token payouts are paused if sponsor/platform hasn't paid, but users can still accrue tokens
  - Sponsors/platforms pay for access to data and to activate user payouts (via tokens, USDT/USDC, credit card, etc.)
- **Automation:**
  - AI-driven survey generation, validation, and scoring
  - Automated outreach to new communities and platforms for survey participation
  - Automated platform profile creation and scoring based on survey data
- **Value:**
  - Community data is used for platform optimization, marketing analytics, and revenue generation
  - Survey system creates a passive, recurring data stream and new revenue channel for the DAO
- **Next Steps:**
  - This is a precursor to the Survey Pro project (see `survey-pro.md` for full platform overview and business model)
