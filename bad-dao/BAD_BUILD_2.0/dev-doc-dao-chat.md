The BAD (Build a DAO) DAO is designed to operate as a lean, bootstrap-ready organization for revenue generation and project incubation, focusing on two key AI-driven products: a Grant & Proposal Writing Studio and a Hackathon Discovery platform. Based on the project requirements and Aragon's capabilities, this guide outlines the essential steps to set up your treasury and governance structure.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Create a tokenized governance platform using Aragon
2. Configure treasury management for bootstrap financing
3. Set up optimal voting mechanisms for decision-making
4. Structure the DAO for the 14-day implementation timeline
5. Integrate with the AI Grant Concierge and Hackathon Discovery systems

```

#### 1. Initial Treasury Allocation

For the bootstrap phase, configure Aragon's treasury with:

- **üîπ Operating Wallet**: For daily expenses and operations (40% of funds)
  - Primarily stablecoins (USDC/DAI)
  - Minimum 2-month runway based on minimal viable expenses

- **üîπ Growth Wallet**: For funding initial projects (40% of funds)
  - Mix of stablecoins and ETH
  - Allocated for Grant Studio development and initial Hackathon prizes

- **üîπ Treasury Reserve**: For long-term sustainability (20% of funds)
  - ETH and stablecoins
  - Locked for at least 12 months

#### 2. Revenue Streams Integration

Configure smart contracts to automatically allocate incoming revenue:

- **üîπ Grant Success Fees**: 60% to operations, 30% to growth, 10% to reserve
- **üîπ Hackathon Platform Fees**: 50% to operations, 40% to growth, 10% to reserve
- **üîπ Service Revenue**: 70% to operations, 20% to growth, 10% to reserve

#### 3. Token Economics

Token distribution should align with bootstrap needs:

- **üîπ Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 BAD tokens
- **üîπ Distribution**:
  - 40% - Core team (vested over 24 months)
  - 30% - Community (for governance participation)
  - 20% - Treasury (for operations and incentives)
  - 10% - Initial advisors and partners

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting System Setup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Member as DAO Member
    participant Token as BAD Token
    participant Gov as Governance System
    participant Treasury as Treasury

    Member->>Token: Hold tokens
    Member->>Gov: Create proposal
    Gov->>Member: Validation check
    Member->>Gov: Submit proposal
    Gov->>Member: Begin voting period
    Member->>Gov: Cast vote
    Gov->>Treasury: Execute proposal
    Treasury->>Member: Confirm execution
```

### 1. Token Configuration

Create a governance token using Aragon's platform with these parameters:

- **Token Name**: BAD Token
- **Token Symbol**: BAD
- **Token Type**: ERC-20 Governance Token
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 BAD

### 2. Voting Parameters

Set up the voting system with these optimal settings for rapid decision-making:

- **üîπ Support Threshold**: 60% (percentage of votes needed for approval)
- **üîπ Minimum Participation**: 15% (percentage of total tokens that must vote)
- **üîπ Voting Duration**: 72 hours maximum (with early execution)
- **üîπ Proposal Creation**: Minimum 1,000 BAD tokens to create proposals
- **üîπ Early Execution**: Enabled (proposals pass as soon as threshold is met)

### 3. Voting Categories

Create specialized voting templates for different proposal types:

- **üîπ Treasury Allocation** (‚â•75% support, 25% participation)
- **üîπ Grant Approvals** (‚â•60% support, 15% participation)
- **üîπ Operational Decisions** (‚â•51% support, 10% participation)
- **üîπ Emergency Actions** (‚â•80% support, 30% participation, 24-hour voting)

## üîê Security Considerations

### Treasury Security
- Use multi-signature wallets requiring at least 3 of 5 signers
- Implement spending limits per transaction
- Set up treasury alerts for large transactions

### Smart Contract Safety
- Use time locks for major treasury changes (24-hour minimum)
- Implement gradual token unlocking mechanism
- Create circuit breakers for emergency situations

### Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Set up separate admin keys for each major system component
- Establish an emergency multi-sig for critical situations

## üîÑ Integration with Revenue Streams

### AI Grant Concierge Integration
- Configure Aragon to accept proposal submissions from the AI system
- Set up automated treasury allocations for approved grants
- Implement tracking for success fees from funded proposals

### Hackathon Discovery Integration
- Create a dedicated Aragon vault for hackathon prize funds
- Implement voting templates for hackathon project approval
- Connect event system to DAO notifications for opportunity alerts

## üìà Scaling Strategy

As the DAO grows beyond the bootstrap phase:

1. Transition from token-based to hybrid governance (reputation + tokens)
2. Implement specialized working groups with delegated autonomy
3. Create subDAOs for each major product line
4. Scale governance model to support increased participation

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Create the Aragon DAO following the configuration in this guide
2. Configure token distribution to core team and initial community
3. Set up the first funding proposals for the AI Grant Concierge
4. Begin active solicitation of hackathon opportunities
