## üí∞ Minimal Funding Requirements

### Essential Gas Funding

Deploying any blockchain-based system requires some minimal funding for transaction fees. Here are the validated minimum requirements:

| Network | Minimum Funding | Approximate USD | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Ethereum Mainnet | 0.05-0.1 ETH | $150-300 | Low - Expensive |
| Polygon | 5-10 MATIC | $5-10 | High - Cost Effective |
| Arbitrum | 0.01-0.02 ETH | $30-60 | Medium |
| Sepolia (Testnet) | 0.05 ETH | $0 (free from faucets) | High - For Testing |

### Securing Initial Gas Funding

1. **Testnet First Approach**
   - Use Sepolia testnet for initial development and testing
   - Obtain free testnet ETH from faucets:
     - https://sepoliafaucet.com/
     - https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

2. **Minimal Mainnet Funding**
   - Target raising $5-10 for Polygon deployment
   - Consider personal funding from founders for this minimal amount
   - Document this as a founder loan to be repaid from initial revenue

## üåê Network Selection Strategy

### Recommended Networks (Ranked by Bootstrap-Friendliness)

1. **Polygon (Recommended for Bootstrap)**
   - Pros: Low gas fees, Aragon support, high adoption
   - Cons: Separate ecosystem from Ethereum mainnet
   - Requirement: MATIC tokens for gas

2. **Arbitrum**
   - Pros: Ethereum L2, growing ecosystem, lower fees than mainnet
   - Cons: Higher fees than Polygon, newer infrastructure
   - Requirement: ETH for gas (smaller amounts than mainnet)

3. **Ethereum Mainnet (Long-term goal)**
   - Pros: Maximum security, adoption, and credibility
   - Cons: Highest gas fees, unsuitable for bootstrapping
   - Requirement: Significant ETH holdings for deployment and operations

### Testnet Strategy

Start with **Sepolia testnet** to:
- Validate all technical components
- Train team on governance operations
- Test integration points with zero cost
- Generate documentation and tutorials
- Identify potential issues before mainnet deployment

## üöÄ Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable DAO (Days 1-7)

1. **Testnet Deployment**
   - Deploy on Sepolia testnet using free testnet ETH
   - Document exact gas costs for each operation
   - Create deployment tutorials and guides

2. **Token Creation**
   - Create BAD token during DAO creation process
   - Configure 1,000,000 initial supply
   - Set token parameters (name, symbol, decimals)
   - Note: No custom vesting in initial deployment

3. **Basic Treasury Setup**
   - Create simple treasury controlled by governance
   - Document future multi-sig implementation plan
   - Create governance proposal templates

### Phase 2: Minimal Production Deployment (Days 8-14)

1. **Polygon Deployment**
   - Deploy BAD DAO on Polygon with minimal configuration
   - Estimated cost: ~$5-10 worth of MATIC
   - Focus on essential functionality only

2. **Revenue First Focus**
   - Configure minimum required governance for revenue generation
   - Launch basic Grant Studio integration
   - Begin hackathon discovery operations

3. **Documentation-Based Governance**
   - Document token allocation plan as governance proposal
   - Create manual vesting tracking system
   - Establish governance enforcement of vesting rules

### Phase 3: Post-Revenue Enhancements (After Initial Revenue)

1. **Treasury Enhancement**
   - Deploy multi-sig wallets
   - Configure proper treasury splits
   - Implement treasury automation

2. **Technical Vesting**
   - Deploy vesting contracts
   - Transfer tokens to vesting contracts
   - Configure vesting parameters

3. **Network Expansion**
   - Consider cross-chain deployment to Ethereum mainnet
   - Implement bridge mechanisms if required
   - Scale governance system

## üè¶ Treasury Bootstrap Process

### Initial Minimal Treasury

1. **Single Treasury Wallet**
   - Start with simplified single treasury controlled by governance
   - Document future treasury structure in governance proposal
   - Require multiple approvals for any fund movement

2. **Manual Treasury Management**
   - Maintain transparent record of all treasury transactions
   - Create manual tracking for treasury allocations (40/40/20 split)
   - Implement strict governance approval for fund movement

### Post-Revenue Treasury Expansion

1. **Multi-sig Implementation**
   - Deploy proper multi-sig wallets for each treasury segment
   - Configure signing requirements (3/5 and 4/5 as documented)
   - Transfer funds according to documented allocation

2. **Treasury Automation**
   - Implement revenue allocation contract
   - Configure automated revenue distribution
   - Set up treasury monitoring and alerts

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance Implementation

### Bootstrap Governance Approach

1. **Token-Based Voting**
   - Configure voting parameters during DAO creation:
     - Support Threshold: 60%
     - Minimum Participation: 15%
     - Voting Duration: 72 hours
   - Enable early execution for efficiency

2. **Simplified Proposal Types**
   - Start with standard proposal format
   - Document specialized proposal types for future implementation
   - Create templates for common proposal needs

### Documentation-Based Policies

1. **Vesting Policy**
   - Create governance proposal documenting vesting schedule
   - Maintain public vesting tracker
   - Enforce vesting through governance decisions

2. **Treasury Allocation Policy**
   - Document treasury allocation rules
   - Create governance proposal for fund movements
   - Maintain transparent record of allocations

## üìä Token Distribution Plan

### Initial Token Allocation

1. **Deployment Allocation**
   - All tokens initially created in deployer wallet
   - Document full allocation plan as first governance proposal
   - Create transparent token tracker

2. **Phased Distribution**
   - Transfer tokens to treasury first (20%)
   - Document team allocation with vesting schedule (40%)
   - Reserve community tokens (30%)
   - Document advisor allocation (10%)

### Manual Vesting Implementation

1. **Team Token Vesting**
   - Create governance-approved vesting schedule
   - Implement manual token release according to schedule
   - Require governance approval for each vesting release
   - Track vesting progress publicly

2. **Community Token Strategy**
   - Document community token distribution strategy
   - Implement manual distribution based on participation
   - Create governance proposals for each distribution event

- Permit function for gasless approvals (if available)

### Aragon-Specific Configuration
- Use standard Aragon OSx deployment

- Configure token parameters during DAO creation process
- Document ENS name for DAO

### Recommended Aragon Plugins

- Multisig plugin (future implementation)
- Admin plugin (for emergency functions)

### Gas Optimization Strategies
- Batch transactions where possible
- Deploy during low gas periods
- Use EIP-1559 gas pricing
