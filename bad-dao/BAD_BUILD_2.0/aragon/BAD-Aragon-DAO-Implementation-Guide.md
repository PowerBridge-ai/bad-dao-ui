## üîç Overview

The Build a DAO (BAD) project is a bootstrap-ready organization designed for revenue generation and project incubation. This implementation guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the BAD DAO on the Aragon platform with a focus on two primary revenue streams:

1. **AI Grant & Proposal Writing Studio**
2. **Hackathon Discovery & Incubation Platform**

This guide ensures the DAO is fully operational within a 14-day timeframe, with particular emphasis on the treasury configuration and voting mechanisms needed to support these revenue-generating activities.

## üéØ Key Objectives

1. **Establish a Bootstrap-Optimized Treasury** - Configure multi-sig wallets and capital allocation for lean operations
2. **Create a Governance Token** - Deploy the BAD token for decentralized decision-making
3. **Implement Streamlined Voting** - Set up specialized voting templates for different proposal types
4. **Enable Revenue Integration** - Configure treasury to connect with AI Grant and Hackathon systems
5. **Ensure 14-Day Launch** - Provide a detailed timeline for expedited implementation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

### Platform Selection
- **Network**: Ethereum (mainnet for production, Sepolia testnet for development)
- **Aragon Version**: Latest Aragon OSx framework (v1.0.0 or higher)
- **Smart Contract Framework**: Aragonese and ERC-20 token standards
- **Frontend**: Aragon App UI with custom integrations for revenue streams

### Development Environment
- Web3 provider (MetaMask or similar)
- Ethers.js or Web3.js for contract interactions
- Node.js environment for development
- Hardhat/Truffle for testing

```

### Wallet Setup Instructions

1. **Operating Wallet Configuration**
   - Create a 3/5 multi-signature wallet for daily operations
   - Allocate 40% of initial funds (primarily in stablecoins)
   - Set transaction limit of 5% of total treasury value per transaction
   - Configure 2/5 signatures for transactions under $1,000

2. **Growth Wallet Configuration**
   - Create a 3/5 multi-signature wallet for product development
   - Allocate 40% of initial funds (mixed stablecoins and ETH)
   - Set transaction limit of 10% of total treasury value per transaction
   - Lock 50% of funds with 7-day timelock for larger expenditures

3. **Reserve Wallet Configuration**
   - Create a 4/5 multi-signature wallet for long-term holdings
   - Allocate 20% of initial funds (primarily in ETH)
   - Implement 30-day timelock for any withdrawals
   - Configure emergency override requiring 5/5 signatures

### Revenue Stream Allocations

Configure automated smart contract allocations for incoming revenue:

| Revenue Source | Operating | Growth | Reserve |
|----------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Grant Success Fees | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| Hackathon Platform Fees | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| Service Revenue | 70% | 20% | 10% |

## ü™ô Token Setup

### Token Parameters

- **Name**: BAD Token
- **Symbol**: BAD
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 BAD
- **Token Type**: ERC-20 Governance Token

### Token Distribution

```mermaid
pie
    title "BAD Token Distribution"
    "Core Team" : 40
    "Community" : 30
    "Treasury" : 20
    "Advisors & Partners" : 10
```

- **Core Team (40%)**: Vested over 24 months with 6-month cliff
- **Community (30%)**: Reserved for governance participation and incentives

### Token Deployment Process

1. Deploy the BAD token using Aragon's token deployment interface
2. Configure the vesting schedules for team and advisor allocations
3. Transfer the treasury allocation to the DAO's treasury
4. Lock the community allocation in a dedicated contract
5. Configure token for use in governance system

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance System

### Voting Configuration

| Grant Approvals | 60% | 15% | 48 hours | 2,500 BAD |
| Operational Decisions | 51% | 10% | 48 hours | 1,000 BAD |
| Emergency Actions | 80% | 30% | 24 hours | 10,000 BAD |
